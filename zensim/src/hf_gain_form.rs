//! THE v1 HF-energy ratio family — one owner for three expressions that were
//! hand-copied at three sites, and the home of the **F17** fix.
//!
//! # The family, and which member is broken
//!
//! v1's basic block ends with three ratio slots built from two pooled second
//! moments (`var_* = Σ(x − μ)²/n`) and one pooled first absolute moment
//! (`mad_* = Σ|x − μ|/n`):
//!
//! ```text
//! var_loss     = max(0, 1 − var_dst/var_src)      bounded [0, 1]
//! tex_loss     = max(0, 1 − mad_dst/mad_src)      bounded [0, 1]
//! contrast_inc = max(0, var_dst/var_src − 1)      UNBOUNDED ABOVE
//! ```
//!
//! All three are `max(0, ·)` of a difference over the **source** term. That
//! bounds the two `loss` members structurally — their numerator can never
//! exceed their denominator — and bounds nothing at all for the `gain` member,
//! whose numerator is the distorted term. A flat source drives `var_src → 0`
//! past the [`VAR_SRC_FLOOR`] gate while the distorted image still carries HF,
//! and the ratio runs away. **The gate is a threshold, not a stabiliser**: it
//! decides *whether* to divide, never *what* to divide by.
//!
//! # F17, measured
//!
//! Over the R6 rev1 tables — 216,756 real pairs, eight corpora, all 372 slots
//! (`docs/PLAN_FEATURE_REV2_2026-09-05.md` §11.2): the twelve `contrast_inc`
//! slots are the **top twelve of all 372 by maximum**, worst **36,465.74**, and
//! the thirteenth slot is **1.972**. The population separates with no overlap.
//! Against the gold photographic holdout's own p99.9 over those slots
//! (CID22, 0.34687) the worst value is **×105,127**. Its two siblings max at
//! exactly `1.000000`, as the algebra above says they must.
//!
//! This is **not** F4's shape. F4's 5.8e6 lives in a bigcodec sweep with no
//! local pixels and fires on ZERO of those 216,756 rows; F17 fires on five
//! distortion corpora and on the training leg, on 0.0198 % of cells.
//!
//! # The fixed form already exists one block over
//!
//! v2's `HF_GAIN` — the same quantity in the same units (squared XYB energy),
//! computed per pixel instead of per pool — is
//! `bounded_excess_pair(hf_dst², hf_src², C_HF)`, i.e.
//! `max(0, a−b)/(a+b+C_HF)`, with `C_HF` declared as *"stabilizer for the HF
//! gain/loss/mag-loss bounded-excess forms"*. So F17 is not a missing idea; it
//! is one block that did not use the idea. [`HfGainForm::BoundedExcess`] is
//! that owner's form applied here.
//!
//! # Why an arm and not just a clamp
//!
//! Because `contrast_inc` is nonzero on 12 % (CID22) to 52 % (KADID) of cells,
//! any bounded form necessarily moves healthy content — so *which* bounded form
//! is a measurement, pre-registered as §11 of the rev2 plan and decided by it,
//! exactly as `ssim_form` handled F4.

//! Core zensim metric computation.
//!
//! Multi-scale SSIM + edge + high-frequency features in XYB color space,
//! with trained weights per feature.
//!
//! # Feature extraction pipeline
//!
//! Both images are converted to the XYB perceptual color space (cube-root LMS,
//! same as ssimulacra2 and butteraugli), then processed at multiple scales.
//! Each scale halves resolution via 2× box downscale. At each scale, 19 features
//! are extracted per XYB channel (X, Y, B): 13 basic + 6 peak/diagnostic,
//! giving **228 features total** (4 scales × 3 channels × 19 features).
//!
//! ## SSIM features (3 per channel per scale)
//!
//! Uses the ssimulacra2 variant of SSIM, which differs from standard SSIM:
//!
//! ```text
//! mu1 = blur(src), mu2 = blur(dst)
//! sigma12 = blur(src * dst)
//! sum_sq  = blur(src² + dst²)     // one blur instead of two
//!
//! num_m   = 1 - (mu1 - mu2)²      // luminance (no C1, no denominator)
//! num_s   = 2·sigma12 - 2·mu1·mu2 + C2   // structure × contrast
//! denom_s = sum_sq - mu1² - mu2² + C2     // = sigma1² + sigma2² + C2
//!
//! d = max(0, 1 - num_m · num_s / denom_s) // per-pixel SSIM error
//! ```
//!
//! The luminance component drops the standard SSIM denominator
//! `(mu1² + mu2² + C1)` — ssimulacra2's reasoning is that the denominator
//! over-weights dark-region errors, which is wrong for perceptually uniform
//! values (XYB is already gamma-like). There is no C1 constant; C2 = 0.0009.
//!
//! The `sum_sq` optimization computes `blur(src² + dst²)` with one blur
//! instead of separate `blur(src²)` and `blur(dst²)`, because the SSIM
//! formula only needs `sigma1² + sigma2²`, not each individually.
//!
//! Three pooling norms capture different aspects of the error distribution:
//! - **ssim_mean** = `mean(d)` — average error
//! - **ssim_4th**  = `(mean(d⁴))^(1/4)` — L4 norm, emphasizes worst-case errors
//! - **ssim_2nd**  = `(mean(d²))^(1/2)` — L2 norm, intermediate sensitivity
//!
//! ## Edge features (6 per channel per scale)
//!
//! Edge detection compares local detail (pixel minus local mean) between
//! source and distorted:
//!
//! ```text
//! diff_src = |src - mu1|    // source edge magnitude
//! diff_dst = |dst - mu2|    // distorted edge magnitude
//!
//! d = (1 + diff_dst) / (1 + diff_src) - 1   // per-pixel edge ratio
//!
//! artifact    = max(0,  d)   // distorted has MORE edge than source
//! detail_lost = max(0, -d)   // distorted has LESS edge than source
//! ```
//!
//! The `1 +` offsets prevent division by zero and dampen sensitivity in flat
//! regions. The ratio formulation is scale-invariant. Splitting into artifact
//! (ringing, banding, blockiness) vs detail_lost (blur, smoothing) lets the
//! model weight them independently.
//!
//! Each is pooled with three norms (mean, L4, L2) = 6 features.
//!
//! ## MSE (1 per channel per scale)
//!
//! Plain mean squared error in XYB space: `mean((src - dst)²)`.
//! No blur dependency, computed directly from pixels.
//!
//! ## High-frequency features (3 per channel per scale)
//!
//! These measure changes in local detail energy by comparing `pixel - blur(pixel)`
//! (the high-frequency residual) between source and distorted. Despite their
//! former names ("variance_loss", "texture_loss", "contrast_increase"), they
//! do NOT measure image variance — they measure the ratio of high-pass energy.
//!
//! ```text
//! hf_src_L2 = Σ(src - mu1)²    // source HF energy (L2)
//! hf_dst_L2 = Σ(dst - mu2)²    // distorted HF energy (L2)
//! hf_src_L1 = Σ|src - mu1|     // source HF magnitude (L1)
//! hf_dst_L1 = Σ|dst - mu2|     // distorted HF magnitude (L1)
//! ```
//!
//! - **hf_energy_loss** = `max(0, 1 - hf_dst_L2 / hf_src_L2)` — detail smoothed away
//! - **hf_mag_loss**    = `max(0, 1 - hf_dst_L1 / hf_src_L1)` — same, L1 (robust to outliers)
//! - **hf_energy_gain** = `max(0, hf_dst_L2 / hf_src_L2 - 1)` — detail added (ringing/sharpening)
//!
//! `hf_energy_loss` and `hf_energy_gain` are the positive and negative halves
//! of the same signal, split by ReLU — this gives the linear model separate
//! knobs for blur vs ringing without needing signed weights.
//!
//! ## Peak features (6 per channel per scale)
//!
//! Computed during the fused V-blur kernel at no extra cost:
//! - **ssim_max**, **art_max**, **det_max** — per-pixel maximum of each error type
//! - **ssim_l8**, **art_l8**, **det_l8** — L8-pooled (near-worst-case) values
//!
//! These capture outlier sensitivity that mean/L2/L4 pooling may miss.
//!
//! ## Scoring
//!
//! All 228 features are multiplied by trained weights, summed, normalized by
//! scale count, then mapped to a 0–100 score via:
//! `score = 100 - a · distance^b` (default a=18.0, b=0.7).

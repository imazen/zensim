//! **THE servability census** — the roster of profiles this build ships, and
//! the gates that every one of them serves its own bake.
//!
//! ## Why it is here and not in `feature_plan`
//!
//! It used to be `feature_plan::servability_census`, which is gated on
//! `feature-regime-v2`. So the one instrument that asks *"can this build serve
//! what it ships?"* did not exist in the builds that could not — and on
//! 2026-09-06 that is exactly what happened: the shipped `A`, `B`, `BHdr` and
//! `D` bakes went DENSE (`cb2f412d`) while the gather that serves a dense
//! declaration lived behind `feature-regime-v2`, so every
//! `--no-default-features` consumer silently got the positional-prefix
//! reading. A census that cannot run in the broken configuration is not a
//! census.
//!
//! Everything here needs only [`ZensimProfile`], [`Zensim::compute`] and
//! `mlp::Model`. The gates that need a `Plan` (revision agreement, the
//! id-space-vs-`from_block_profile` cross-check) stay in `feature_plan` and
//! import the roster from here, so there is still exactly one roster.

//! Featcanon (2026-09-25): canonical feature arithmetic behind
//! [`crate::feature_defs::FormulaRevision::Rev4`], plus the measurement
//! substrate that chose it (`benchmarks/featcanon_WORKLOG.md`).
//!
//! The problem: several extraction kernels emit different bits per SIMD tier
//! because (a) `mul_add` is fused on v3/v4/neon but plain `a*b+c` on the
//! magetypes scalar and wasm128 backends, (b) `reduce_add`'s tree is
//! backend-defined (16-lane native on v4, 2×8-lane on v3, array-order on
//! scalar), and (c) per-tier tail/chunk geometry differs (width-16 vs width-8
//! vs remainder paths). [`era2_reduce8`] established the
//! fix pattern for the dense block kernel; this module generalises it: one
//! body, fixed virtual-lane accumulation, a written-out reduction tree, and
//! `f32::mul_add` (the fused intrinsic on every target) wherever the formula
//! is a product-sum.
//!
//! **The arithmetic is chosen PER COMPUTATION, never per process.** Every
//! canonical leaf receives the revision of the computation it serves and asks
//! [`mode`] with it. `ZENSIM_FORMULA_REV` does not reach a leaf through this
//! module: it only chooses which revision a caller that did not name one
//! gets, and the entries refuse every request whose revision disagrees with
//! the process revision when either is Rev4 (see
//! [`crate::ssim_form::refuse_rev4_mix`]), because other formula gates still
//! read the process switch.
//!
//! **Served at Rev4 (REV4SERVE).** The served leaves are canonical too:
//! the PU front end runs `color::pu_xyb_canon` over the `_at_revision`
//! transfer decoders, `streaming::active_channels` routes every active
//! channel through the fused SSIM kernels at Rev4 (the edge-only
//! `blur::fused_blur_h_mu` chain and the MSE-only `sq_diff_sum` leaf never
//! run), and the fold walk's block kernels already select their canon arms.
//! Rev1–Rev3 bytes are unchanged; a Rev4 process serves Rev4 computations
//! bit-identically across tiers, and [`crate::ssim_form::refuse_rev4_mix`]
//! keeps every cross-boundary mix refused.
//!
//! **Measurement modes are not in a product build.** `ZENSIM_FEATCANON`
//! (`exact`/`c32`/`c64`/`neum`/`off`) and the f64 exact-oracle bodies exist
//! only with the `oracle` cargo feature, the crate's precedent for a ruler
//! that is not semantics. A product build knows two arithmetics: production
//! (Rev1–Rev3) and [`Mode::Canon64`] (Rev4).

// ============================================================
// Free raw-moments accumulation — shared across every SIMD tier
// (`benchmarks/free_features_2026-09-01.md`, `benchmarks/profile_d_notax_2026-09-01.md`)
// ============================================================
//
// The four FREE raw moments (`Σs, Σd, Σs², Σd²` — `V1FreeExtras::RawMoments`,
// `StripChannelAccum::sum_s` etc.) are the same two-line accumulate + one
// conditional four-line finish at every call site, independent of lane
// width or which concrete SIMD backend produced the row's `s`/`d` values.
// Before this pair of helpers the sequence was hand-duplicated at 6 vector
// sites (`_v4`'s and `_v4x`'s native f32x16 main loops, `_v4`'s and `_v4x`'s
// f32x8 REMAINDER loops via `token.v3()`, `_v3`'s native f32x8 main loop,
// and the `#[magetypes(neon, wasm128, scalar)]`-generated function's f32x8
// main loop) plus 4 scalar-tail sites — the free-features doc's own count.
// Consolidating the two WIDTHS into one generic definition each removes the
// vector-site duplication (6 -> 2 source definitions, still 6 call sites)
// and is also the "no waste, no effort duplication" extension point a
// future `V1FreeExtras` variant (a "class C" slot — see the free-features
// doc §4) can reuse without re-deriving or re-copying this arithmetic a
// 7th/8th/9th time: add the new lane-accumulate step here once, call it
// from wherever the new class needs it.
//
// `#[inline(always)]`, not `#[rite]`: both helpers are GENERIC over a
// backend TRAIT (`T: F32x8Backend` / `T: F32x16Backend`), not a concrete
// token, so there is no single `#[target_feature]` string to attach at the
// definition site the way `#[rite]` needs for a concrete-token function —
// each monomorphized instantiation inherits its caller's already-established
// feature region purely through ordinary generic inlining, exactly like
// every other `T: F32x8Backend`-generic kernel in this codebase
// (`feature_v2.rs`'s `dense_block_kernel_generic`, `ssim_d_local_v`, etc.).
// `dense_block_kernel_generic`'s own doc comment already carries the
// MEASURED reason forcing the inline is mandatory here too: an un-inlined
// generic SIMD helper compiles to a call into a `core::arch` shim OUTSIDE
// the `#[target_feature]` region, measured as a 5.3x whole-extraction
// regression on that kernel. Verified inlined away on this refactor: `nm -C`
// on the compiled `ssim2_speed_bar` release binary shows the tier entry
// points present (`zensim::fused::__arcane_fused_vblur_ssim_inner_{v3,v4,v4x}`)
// and zero occurrences of `raw_moments_accumulate`/`raw_moments_finish`
// anywhere in the binary — no un-inlined call site survives.

/// Accumulate one row's contribution to the four free raw-moment lane sums.
/// Bit-identical to the hand-inlined `fm_s = fm_s + s; …` sequence it
/// replaces — same operations, same order, same intermediate rounding
/// (`s * s` before adding, not any fused/reassociated form).
/// Masked and IW pools of the v1 "372" extension, fused into the V sweep
/// (revision 3 only). The separate passes — `simd_ops::ssim_signal_inline_both`,
/// `edge_diff_channel_inline_both`, `build_inline_mse` — form exactly the same
/// per-pixel values from the same inputs; what differs is the ORDER the f64
/// chunk sums are added in (column-group-major here, row-major there), so the
/// pooled slots move at the last f64 bits and the families are registered as
/// a moved era. `act` is the V-blurred activity `blur(|src - H(src)|)`, from

// `fused_vblur_ssim_exact` is the exact-oracle arm: identical loop shape with

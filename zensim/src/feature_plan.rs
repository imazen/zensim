//! **The extraction PLAN** — one derivation from "what a consumer needs" to
//! "what the walk must run and how wide the answer is".
//!
//! Design: `docs/FEATURE_SYSTEM_DESIGN_2026-09-05.md` §5. Phases + gates:
//! `docs/PLAN_FEATURE_SYSTEM_2026-09-05.md`.
//!
//! Declared feature IDs and the formula revision determine one compute/layout
//! plan for dense and legacy identity bakes. The previous block-profile
//! fallback is retired; it enabled a BANDVIS variant absent from training.
//! The September 7 canonical-pixel and serving-census gates cover the change.
//!
//! ## Universal servability
//!
//! The contract (user directive, 2026-09-05: *"also make sure everything can
//! be served"*): **every bake whose read set consists of registered feature
//! ids at a supported revision is servable**, in any declared layout. There is
//! no "trains fine, cannot be served" class. A genuinely unregistered read is
//! refused LOUDLY, by [`PlanError`], naming the slots — never served as
//! silent zeros.

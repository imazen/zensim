//! **THE one owner of the SCORE path's arithmetic.**
//!
//! Five pieces of float math turn a bake's forward-pass output into a shipped
//! zensim score: the two mixing heads (per-sample-α and hybrid), the tanh
//! output pin, the PCHIP output-calibration spline, and the distance→score
//! mapping. Every one of them was implemented TWICE — once here (reached
//! through [`crate::metric`], the product runtime) and once in
//! `zensim-validate`, whose bake-evaluation tooling scores runtime-loaded bake
//! bytes over stored parquet rows and therefore cannot call the product
//! entry points, which consume a compile-time `ZensimProfile` and a
//! `ZensimResult`.
//!
//! # The defect this module exists for
//!
//! The duplication was documented as bit-exact **in prose, with no test
//! binding the two**, and F19 turned that prose into a live wrong-number bug:
//! [`crate::det_math::PowForm`] routes every transcendental on this path
//! through one selectable form so a score stops being a function of which
//! libm the binary linked against, and `metric.rs` follows it while the
//! mirror did not. Both defaults are [`PowForm::LibmPowf`] today, so the two
//! agree; the day [`crate::ssim_form::SHIPPED_REVISION`] flips they would
//! silently disagree, and every published verdict would describe arithmetic
//! the product does not run. `det_math`'s own exposure table named that fork
//! *"a BLOCKER on flipping `SHIPPED_REVISION`"*.
//!
//! MEASURED before the fix (2026-09-06, six shipped/board bakes ×
//! `cid22,kadid,tid,konjnd,aic3`): `bake_verdict --full-json` was
//! **byte-identical under `ZENSIM_POW_FORM=libm` and `=pure` on all six** —
//! i.e. the evaluation tooling was completely insensitive to the form the
//! product runtime obeys. That is the fork, observed rather than argued.
//!
//! A second divergence fell out of the same consolidation, REAL in code and
//! LATENT in practice: the validate-side PCHIP evaluator capped its upper
//! *extrapolation* at 100 (the 2026-07-04 fix) but left the *interior*
//! segment uncapped, while [`pchip_eval_capped`] — the product's — caps both.
//! The reachable trigger is **a knot whose `y` exceeds 100**, which the wire
//! format permits (`parse_payload` bounds `x` strictly increasing and both
//! finite, and bounds `y` not at all). It is NOT Hermite overshoot: the
//! Fritsch-Carlson derivative rule keeps the interpolant inside its
//! bracketing knots by construction, and a first draft of
//! `the_pchip_interior_is_capped_at_one_hundred` that tried to build an
//! overshoot fixture failed its own vacuity guard proving it.
//!
//! MEASURED over all 49 bakes on disk (`zensim/weights`, its `archive/`, and
//! `zensim-experimental/weights`): **0 declare a knot above 100**, so no
//! published verdict moved. The divergence was a loaded gun, not a fired one.
//! Unifying removes it by construction.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! The head parameters arrive in two different owned layouts — `metric.rs`
//! parses them into private structs, `zensim-validate` into public tuples —
//! so the entry points here take **borrowed** parameter views
//! ([`PerSampleAlphaParams`], [`HybridHeadParams`]). Both callers build one
//! for free; neither allocates, and neither has to adopt the other's storage.
//!
//! The [`PowForm`] is an explicit argument rather than a
//! [`crate::det_math::active_pow_form`] read inside, for two reasons: it is
//! the discipline `det_math` already documents (read the `OnceLock` ONCE,
//! above any loop — LLVM will not hoist it for you), and it is what lets a
//! test exercise BOTH arms in one process, which a process-wide `OnceLock`
//! forbids.
//!
//! # `#[doc(hidden)]`
//!
//! Internal machinery, not product surface. The supported API
//! (`docs/public-api/zensim.txt`) is unchanged; these items are registered in
//! `docs/public-api/zensim.internal.txt`.

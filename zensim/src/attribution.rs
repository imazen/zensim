//! Attribution-density steering map (task #67, C1) — `custom-profiles` research API.
//!
//! Builds a per-pixel **attribution density** `D(x, y)` for a scalar model's
//! gradient `s_k = ∂score/∂f_k` over the BASIC feature block (f0-155: 13 slots
//! × 3 channels × 4 scales, scale-major `scale*39 + ch*13 + slot`), plus a
//! summed-area table for O(1) arbitrary-rectangle queries.
//!
//! # Why this exists (E-M6..E-M9, `benchmarks/coherent089_seeded_frontier_2026-07-27.md`)
//!
//! The per-pixel *signal fold* (`DiffmapWeighting::ModelSensitivity`) blends
//! scales by gradient mass and renormalizes per scale, so a model whose mass
//! sits on coarse-scale MSE degrades to a 1/8-resolution map — block ranking
//! (M3) collapses to 0.1-0.3 and inverts at 128 px, while the per-block
//! gradient attribution `Σ_k s_k·Δf_k(block)` (M2) stays 0.999-1.000 at every
//! block size. This module productizes the M2 mechanism: each feature's
//! per-pixel contribution is laid down with its **TRUE integrand and ABSOLUTE
//! normalization** (no per-scale renormalization, no mass blend — `s_k`
//! carries the weight), so a rectangle sum over any block is the first-order
//! prediction of the score gain from refining that block.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! [`AttributionResult::query_rect`] over block `B` approximates
//! `Σ_k s_k · Δf_k(B)` — the linearized scalar-score gain from re-encoding
//! `B` at reference quality — for ANY axis-aligned rectangle, at O(1) cost.
//! This is the codec-facing steering surface for variable partitions (AV1
//! 4-128 px recursive, JXL variable DCT, HEVC CTU splits): the codec queries
//! its own partition geometry directly instead of consuming a fixed-grid map.
//!
//! # Integrands (verified against `finalize()` / `fused_vblur_features_ssim`)
//!
//! Per (scale, channel), the 13 basic slots pool per-pixel signals as:
//!
//! | slot | feature | pooling | per-pixel signal `v` |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | 0/1/2 | ssim mean/4th/2nd | mean / p4 / p2 | `sd` (SSIM error) |
//! | 3/4/5 | art mean/4th/2nd | mean / p4 / p2 | `max(0, ed)`, `ed = (1+|d−μ2|)/(1+|s−μ1|) − 1` |
//! | 6/7/8 | det mean/4th/2nd | mean / p4 / p2 | `max(0, −ed)` |
//! | 9 | mse | mean | `(s − d)²` |
//! | 10 | hf_energy_loss | `max(0, 1 − varDst/varSrc)` | `(s−μ1)²`, `(d−μ2)²` |
//! | 11 | hf_mag_loss | `max(0, 1 − madDst/madSrc)` | `\|s−μ1\|`, `\|d−μ2\|` |
//! | 12 | hf_energy_gain | `max(0, varDst/varSrc − 1)` | same as 10 |
//!
//! - **Mean-pooled** (slots 0,3,6,9): `d_k(i) = v_i / N` — the pixel's exact
//!   share of the feature. Full-plane sum = the feature value exactly.
//! - **p-pooled** (slots 1,2,4,5,7,8; `f = (mean(v^p))^{1/p}`):
//!   `d_k(i) = (1/p) · (v_i^p / N) · M^{(1−p)/p}` with `M = mean(v^p)`.
//!   The `1/p` factor makes the block sum the **removal-consistent first
//!   order**: zeroing block `B`'s members changes `M` by `−ΔM_B` linearly, so
//!   `Δf ≈ −(1/p)·ΔM_B·M^{1/p−1}`. The raw value-weighted gradient
//!   `v_i·∂f/∂v_i = (v_i^p/N)·M^{(1−p)/p}` (Euler form, sums to `f`) is the
//!   `t→0` path derivative of *scaling* the block and over-weights p-pooled
//!   slots by ×p relative to their true block-removal effect — wrong relative
//!   weighting against mean slots, so the `1/p` form is used. Per-slot block
//!   RANKING is identical either way (same `M` for all blocks); only the
//!   cross-slot mix differs.
//! - **hf ratio slots** (10-12): exact first-order integrands of the clamped
//!   ratio, gated on the clamp state (`varSrc > 1e-10` matching `finalize`,
//!   loss XOR gain active). With `e_i = (s_i−μ1_i)² − (d_i−μ2_i)²`:
//!   slot 10 active ⇒ `d_10(i) = e_i / Σe_src²`; slot 12 active ⇒
//!   `d_12(i) = −e_i / Σe_src²`; slot 11 active ⇒
//!   `d_11(i) = (|s_i−μ1_i| − |d_i−μ2_i|) / Σ|s−μ1|`. These are SIGNED —
//!   e.g. a ringing block inside a globally-blurred image genuinely
//!   *increases* `hf_energy_loss` when refined, and the density carries that.
//!   Full-plane sums equal the (unclamped-side) feature values exactly.
//!
//! Sign convention matches `ModelSensitivity`: the map weight is `−s_k`
//! (score-oriented models have negative sensitivity on error signals →
//! positive map weight = "refining here gains score"). The map is **signed**.
//!
//! Coarse scales are upsampled **sum-preservingly**: a scale-`s` pixel's
//! density spreads uniformly over its `2^s × 2^s` full-resolution footprint
//! divided by the footprint area (nearest-neighbor ÷ area, NOT bilinear), so
//! rectangle sums reproduce coarse-plane sums exactly.
//!
//! # Honest approximations / blind spots
//!
//! 1. **f156-371 (peak/masked/iw) and any block beyond are NOT spatialized**
//!    — same structural blind spot as the signal fold. The harness prints the
//!    dropped `|s_k|` mass per bake.
//! 2. **Blur bleed** (C2b MEASURED): refining block `B` also changes signals
//!    within the blur radius outside `B`. The pure-window-supported signals
//!    (ssim `d`; v2 contrast/texture) ARE spread over their blur window via
//!    the sum-preserving box spread (`blur::box_spread_sum_preserving`,
//!    clipped-window per-source-normalized convention) — measured NEUTRAL on
//!    the 8-cell gate (±0.003). Residual-form signals (art/det/hf/mscn) stay
//!    pixel-allocated: the 50/50 pixel/window split was measured and
//!    REGRESSED all 8 cells (−0.01..−0.08), and the pure `I − K` adjoint
//!    allocates zero net mass (wrong for removal semantics). The remaining
//!    fine-block residual is the finite-removal floor, not an allocation
//!    fix — see `benchmarks/attribution_map_c1_2026-07-29.md` §C2b.
//! 3. **SIMD-padding columns** (padded width − width) carry feature mass that
//!    the trimmed map cannot attribute (≤ ~3 % of columns; near-zero signal
//!    since both planes zero-pad identically).
//! 4. **p-root curvature** beyond first order for large removals, and **hf
//!    clamp state** assumed fixed under refinement.
//! 5. The internal V-blur banding replicates the production 32-row band
//!    layout, so per-pixel signals and pooled scalars are bit-compatible with
//!    the production feature extractor (`sum-preservation` tests below).

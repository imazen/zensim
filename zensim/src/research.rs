//! **The RESEARCH engine** — one named, complete entry that computes every
//! registered signal at any registered revision, with per-feature provenance.
//!
//! Design: `docs/FEATURE_SYSTEM_DESIGN_2026-09-05.md` §5.3. Phase + gates:
//! `docs/PLAN_FEATURE_SYSTEM_2026-09-05.md` phase 2.
//!
//! ## What this is, and what it deliberately is NOT
//!
//! The design sketched the research engine as *"buffered / oracle-backed,
//! reference semantics"* against a production engine on *"the fold, minimal
//! plan"*. **Two of those three words did not survive contact with the code,
//! and the reasons are measurements, not opinions:**
//!
//! * **It cannot be the buffered walk.** `streaming::compute_multiscale_
//!   stats_streaming` — the BUFFERED path, whose name says "streaming" for a
//!   different reason (see CLAUDE.md's naming-trap note) — has no
//!   `V2NewFeatureToggles` parameter and contains no reference to
//!   `append_block` / `csfw_block` at all. It is structurally v1-only, i.e.
//!   it tops out at 372 of the 956 registered slots. A research engine that
//!   cannot compute two thirds of the registry is not comprehensive.
//! * **It cannot be oracle-backed by default.** `feature_v2::oracle`'s
//!   `Neumaier` and `Exact` accumulators produce *different bits* from the
//!   production reduction — that is their whole purpose as a ruler. Making
//!   them the research engine's arithmetic would make G2.1 (bit-exact parity
//!   with production on every shared id) unsatisfiable **by construction**.
//!   The oracle stays what it already is: the standing precision ruler,
//!   gated separately (`era2_oracle_bounds_hold_for_every_pool_shape`).
//!
//! So the research engine is a **plan-driven, full-width, deterministic entry
//! to the fold walk** — which is exactly the machinery that already computes
//! every registered block. What it ADDS over calling the walk by hand is:
//!
//! 1. it takes a [`Plan`](crate::feature_plan::Plan) rather than a hand-built
//!    toggle struct, so "what runs" has one owner and cannot drift from "what
//!    was asked for";
//! 2. **per-feature provenance** — id, name, family, scale, channel,
//!    statistic, cost, form, direction, owning kernel, resolved revision,
//!    live defect, and whether the plan populated it or left a structural
//!    zero;
//! 3. a **revision selector** that resolves each slot's semantics from the
//!    registry and refuses LOUDLY, naming slots, when a caller asks for an
//!    era this build cannot reproduce.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! [`Request::everything`] is single-threaded by default, so a research
//! extraction is deterministic by construction. Thread invariance is still
//! GATED rather than assumed ([`tests::research_output_is_thread_invariant`]):
//! the same request with `parallel` on must be bit-identical across rayon
//! pool sizes 1/2/3/8/16 **and** equal to the serial answer — the standard
//! `v1_feature_width_pure_function.rs` already holds the v1 extractor to.

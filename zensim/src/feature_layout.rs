//! **Layer 2 — the LAYOUT**, a declared mapping from feature ids to positions
//! in an emitted vector.
//!
//! Design: `docs/FEATURE_SYSTEM_DESIGN_2026-09-05.md` §4. Phase 4 of
//! `docs/PLAN_FEATURE_SYSTEM_2026-09-05.md`.
//!
//! ## What this makes expressible that was not
//!
//! Phase 1 landed `layout_width` + `LayoutBlocks::for_width` and recorded WHY
//! (`PLAN_FEATURE_SYSTEM` §1b): every layout registered at the time was the
//! IDENTITY mapping over its range, so a full `id -> position` map would have
//! been a type with no consumer and no test that could distinguish it from the
//! width it wrapped. That is no longer true — a **dense** layout has a
//! different mapping, and phase 4 is where it gets its first real consumer.
//!
//! Three facts follow, none of which held before:
//!
//! 1. **The legacy widths are DECLARATIONS, not code paths.** `w156`, `w372`,
//!    `w504`, `w720`, `w924`, `w944`, `w956` are `Layout`s whose `slot_at[i]
//!    == Some(i)`. Every stored table, every shipped bake and every board row
//!    is already in one of them, so **no stored byte moves**.
//! 2. **A structural zero is a LAYOUT property, not a data property.** A
//!    position whose id the plan does not compute is written `0.0` *because
//!    the layout declares that id lives there and the plan does not populate
//!    it* — the distinction `FEATURE_SET_IDS.md` §3.1 says is missing when
//!    seven different feature sets are all called "944".
//! 3. **A dense subset is expressible.** [`Layout::dense`] packs a read set
//!    with no gaps, which is what retires "944-with-structural-zeros as the
//!    wire format" for NEW artifacts without touching the 944 that exists.
//!
//! ## Why the gather is a real safety fix, not a tidiness one
//!
//! Before this, `metric::prep_bake_input_f32` resolved a width disagreement
//! POSITIONALLY: `n_inputs < features.len()` took the first `n_inputs`
//! positions. For every bake that exists today that is correct, because every
//! declared width is a PREFIX of the walk's identity layout. The moment a
//! dense table exists it stops being correct — a 265-input bake over
//! `basic+peaks+moments` would silently be served `f0..265`, which is
//! `basic + peaks + 37 slots of masked` — plausible numbers, wrong features,
//! no error. A declared layout turns that into a gather, and an *undeclarable*
//! width into a loud refusal.

//! The fold-backed scoring engine — "the fold becomes the engine".
//!
//! zensim ships two walks over the same statistic:
//!
//! * **buffered** ([`crate::streaming::compute_multiscale_stats_streaming`]):
//!   whole-image XYB pyramids for both sides, band-processed per scale. This
//!   is what [`crate::Zensim::compute`] has always run.
//! * **the fold** ([`crate::feature_v2`]'s `foldapp_streaming_walk`): rolling
//!   planes, no materialised pyramid, O(strip) plane residency.
//!
//! Since option C (`blur::pyramid_plane_stride(w) == w`, 2026-08-30) the
//! fold's `f0..372` is **bit-identical** to v1's 372-feature extraction at
//! every width — gated by
//! `feature_v2::tests::v1_372_bit_exact_to_fold_at_every_width` over 19
//! geometries. What was still missing was everything between a feature vector
//! and a [`ZensimResult`]: the fold is an extractor, and
//! `ZensimV2Result` has no `score()`.
//!
//! This module is that missing piece, and it is deliberately thin. It does
//! **not** re-implement any scoring:
//!
//! | job | owner |
//! |---|---|
//! | sub-64 reflect-pad, byte-identical short-circuit | [`crate::metric`], shared, unchanged |
//! | extraction | the fold (`compute_folded_v1_372_streaming_impl`) |
//! | `mean_offset` | the fold, via `feature_v2::MeanOffsetRows` |
//! | sanitize + weight dot + score mapping | [`crate::metric::score_v1_layout_features`], shared |
//! | bake forward, α/hybrid head, tanh pin, PCHIP output spline, per-codec affine, clamp disposition | [`crate::metric::apply_mlp_scoring_with_codec`], untouched |
//!
//! The bake/spline machinery attaches *under* this module, not into it:
//! `apply_mlp_scoring_with_codec` consumes a finished `ZensimResult` plus the
//! original `(width, height)` and does not care which walk produced it. That
//! is the whole reason the fold-backed engine is additive rather than a
//! rewrite.
//!
//! ## What the engine does NOT cover, and why
//!
//! * **`num_scales != crate::NUM_SCALES`.** The fold is hard-wired to 4
//!   scales; a `ZensimConfig` (the `training`-feature surface) asking for a
//!   different pyramid falls back to buffered rather than silently scoring a
//!   different pyramid. At 4, `min_pyramid_dim_for_scales(4) ==
//!   MIN_PYRAMID_DIM == 64`, so the two paths' reflect-pad decisions coincide
//!   exactly.
//! * **Declared-HDR / PU-linear input.** `compute_pu_linear*` runs the PU
//!   front-end; the fold has a PU front-end too, but its mean-offset path is
//!   not wired, so those entries keep buffered.
//! * **Non-default blur config.** The fold implements `blur_radius = 5`,
//!   `blur_passes = 1` — every shipped profile's values. Anything else falls
//!   back.
//!
//! [`is_fold_backable`] is the single owner of that predicate.

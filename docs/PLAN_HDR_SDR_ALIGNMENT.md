# PLAN_HDR_SDR_ALIGNMENT — one dial across SDR, HDR, and tone-mapping (drafted 2026-07-14)

User directive (2026-07-14): examine all techniques for an optimal HDR metric +
historical achievements, and design SDR↔HDR alignment such that (a) similar
perceptual differences in SDR and HDR content get similar scores, and (b) a
tone-mapped rendition of an HDR pair scores near the HDR pair — "close enough
to make human sense."

Companion to `PLAN_HDR.md` (training + dial continuity) and `PLAN_BEAT_A.md`
(Bet2 human triplets). Evidence base: `benchmarks/
bhdr_improvement_split_lineage_2026-07-12.md` §1–§8.15.

## 1. The alignment problem, formalized

zensim is a user-facing dial: "give me 85" must mean the same visual quality
whether the asset is SDR, HDR, or an SDR tone-map of an HDR master. Three
requirements, in decreasing strictness:

- **R1 — sub-domain identity.** SDR-range content scored through the HDR path
  must equal the SDR path. (Already a pre-registered gate:
  G-HDR-SDR-CONSISTENCY in PLAN_HDR — p95 |Δ| ≤ 2 pt, rank ≥ 0.99. The SDR
  case is the sub-domain limit; no luminance seam.)
- **R2 — cross-domain equal-difference.** If humans judge an SDR pair and an
  HDR pair equally far from their references (in JND), both get ≈ the same
  dial value.
- **R3 — tone-map near-consistency.** `M_sdr(TM(R), TM(D)) ≈ M_hdr(R, D)`,
  with divergence permitted exactly where tone mapping genuinely changes
  visibility (highlight quantization crushed by the curve; banding revealed
  by range compression). NOT strict invariance — "human sense" means the
  deviation should be explainable, not zero.

**Exchange currency: JND/JOD.** The only psychophysically defensible
cross-domain unit. cvvdp emits JOD for any display model (SDR or HDR
photometry); the AIC-3 triplet method reconstructs JND scales; UPIQ's whole
contribution is re-aligning four datasets onto one JOD axis. The dial should
be a monotone, domain-blind function of JND-from-reference.

## 2. Technique inventory (what we hold today)

**Luminance encodings / front-ends**
- PU21 u8-shell (v1): PU-encode absolute nits → rescale to u8 → SDR feature
  extractor. Display-relative; auto-normalizes brightness (loses absolute-
  luminance masking, gains scale comparability).
- PU-linear (v3, `compute_pu_linear_extended_features`): absolute-nits PU
  values straight into the 372-D extended-feature front-end. The production
  BHdr regime. ⚠ Regime purity is load-bearing — §8.13's confound came from
  mixing regimes in one gram; tooling now enforces
  (`--features-name`, upiq_panel warning, GROUPS comments).
- PQ code-value domain for distortion GENERATION (kadis-hdr,
  normalize=truncate never mapmm) — synthesis-side, not metric-side.
- `--hdr-transfer pu-rescale` scoring shells per metric: cvvdp + butteraugli
  faithful linear planes; ssim2/iwssim/zensim PU21 u8 shells; dssim
  HdrUnsupported by design.

**Teachers (measured)**
- cvvdp-mix `0.5·ssim2norm + 0.5·clamp((JOD−6)/4)` — the shipped BHdr lever
  (§6). cvvdp-scalar-ONLY: falsified twice (V41 + 2026-05-27) — emulating
  cvvdp's output ≠ having its mechanism.
- iwssim-teacher (iw_logn spread): mechanism diagnostics strong, selection
  transfer falsified (§8.5–8.6). Teacher-ceiling measured (§8.3).
- ssim2: reliable q50–90 band, saturates HQ (measured: cvvdp-agree 0.82→0.48
  by zone).

**Calibration & packing**
- Monotone PCHIP output spline (dial), fit on the PROJECTED+QUANTIZED net;
  `bake_dial_refit` subcommands incl. `shared-anchor` (whole-spline refit to
  a shared anchor — the co-calibration primitive R2 needs).
- winsor_p99 feature guards — measured to matter: they tame the JXL
  near-lossless OOD tails (~24× L2) and are part of why the baked BHdr
  outscores its raw fit head on UPIQ.
- f16 QAT-native packing (SROCC-neutral by construction).

**Model families (measured)**
- Linear 372→1 shaped: the champion family — deterministic, no collapse
  axis (44/44 byte-identical refits), 1–12 KB. B (SDR) + BHdr both live here.
- MLPs: higher ceiling on some axes, collapse modes (2/9 seeds), KonJND/f16
  trade; per-sample-α, routers/ensembles for G5: falsified.

**Instruments**
- UPIQ **full** set is local (verified 2026-07-14): 4,159 rows on ONE
  JOD-aligned scale — tid2013 3,000 + live 779 (SDR, `is_hdr=0`) +
  narwaria 140 + korshunov 240 (HDR). We have only ever extracted the HDR
  380. ⚠ tid2013 overlaps training (integrity-guard grade); **live(779) is
  clean** of our corpora. HDR-380 remains confirmation-only (burn ledger
  ~22 looks).
- Dial grids (densified), bake_verdict rank panel, upiq_panel (--strata,
  --compare, regime-warned), KonJND PJND anchor.
- Corpora: jxl-HDR (PU-linear), kadis-hdr (both regimes now), UltraHDR/HEIC
  gain-map ingest (`ultrahdr` crate: gain-map math + tone mapping — the TM
  operator source for R3 bridges).

## 3. Historical achievements + falsification ledger (the short version)

Achievements:
- BHdr (linear, cvvdp-mix, PU-linear): UPIQ pooled **0.7536** / narwaria
  **0.7834** / korshunov **0.9175** — above ssim2-HDR (0.704) and Profile A
  (0.694), just under raw cvvdp (0.758), below iwssim-HDR (0.808).
- B↔BHdr routing identity test passes byte-for-byte on descriptor-flagged
  SDR content (the R1 seed).
- HDR corpus estate: jxl-HDR + kadis-hdr (11,400 cells × 5 metrics + both
  feature regimes), fleet + jobexec ScoreFile-HDR machinery.
- Pre-registration discipline that caught its own confound (§8.11→§8.15).

Falsified (do NOT retry without new evidence): cvvdp-scalar target ×2;
CSF-feature engineering for the AIC-3 gap; synthetic corpus breadth for UPIQ
transfer (clean, §8.15); iw-teacher selection; G5 single-MLP weighting +
regime-routed ensembles; corpus-refit of the cid head.

## 4. Alignment mechanisms (design)

**A. Sub-domain identity (R1) — structural, mostly done.** Keep the single
PU-linear substrate; BHdr restricted to ≤ ~100–200 nits IS the SDR case.
Strengthen from "gate" to "training constraint": add a distillation term on
SDR corpora — penalize |BHdr(pu_linear(sdr)) − B(sdr)| — so identity holds
by construction, not luck. Cheap: no new labels, SDR corpora are huge.

**B. Cross-domain equal-difference (R2) — calibrate on one JOD axis.**
1. Extract UPIQ **SDR-half** features (both regimes; live-779 first —
   clean). Instrument: regress dial vs UPIQ-JOD across `is_hdr` ∈ {0,1};
   ALIGNED ⇔ one monotone mapping fits both halves with no domain dummy
   (report the domain-offset coefficient + per-half residuals).
2. Joint spline co-calibration: build ONE multiband anchor whose
   `target_score` lives on a JOD-derived 0–100 scale spanning SDR + HDR
   cells; refit B's and BHdr's splines against it
   (`bake_dial_refit shared-anchor` — rank-invariant, kills systematic
   scale seams). Near-threshold pinning: "visually lossless" ≈ dial 63 in
   BOTH domains (KonJND anchors SDR; cvvdp-JOD ≥ ~9.5 proxies HDR until
   human PJND exists).

**C. Tone-map bridge (R3) — teacher-explained divergence.**
1. Build the bridge corpus: for each HDR pair (R,D) in jxl-HDR/kadis-hdr,
   produce (TM(R), TM(D)) with 2–3 operators (ultrahdr gain-map path,
   BT.2446-style, simple photographic). Score: dial_hdr(R,D),
   dial_sdr(TM pair), cvvdp_hdr (HDR display model), cvvdp_sdr (SDR display
   model on the TM pair).
2. The teacher's Δ_JOD = cvvdp_hdr − cvvdp_sdr is the VISIBILITY-CHANGE
   ground truth (how much the TM actually hid/revealed). Alignment metric:
   residual = (dial_hdr − dial_sdr) − s·Δ_JOD after a single global slope s;
   gate on p95 |residual| (proposal: ≤ 5 dial pts; tighten after measuring).
   This formalizes "close enough to make human sense": deviations are
   allowed exactly where the visibility teacher says they should exist.
3. MEASURE FIRST (instrument before lever): run the bridge on current
   B/BHdr before training anything — the misalignment magnitude and its
   structure (offset? content-dependent? TM-dependent?) decides which lever
   (spline co-calibration alone vs consistency-trained head).
4. If a lever is needed: add the bridge consistency term to the next BHdr
   registration — loss += λ·|(M_hdr − M_sdr∘TM) − s·Δ_JOD_teacher|. This is
   supervision we can synthesize at scale TODAY (no human labels needed for
   the CONSISTENCY signal; humans still gate via UPIQ/own-triplets).

**D. Display conditioning (forward-looking).** A peak-nits/display scalar
input (A_Phone precedent: narrow dial was CORRECT cvvdp-emulation for that
display). One head serving 600-nit phone vs 4000-nit monitor is the honest
generalization of "HDR metric"; defer until R1–R3 land.

## 5. Ordered program (each step lands an artifact; registrations before fits)

1. **UPIQ-full extraction** (SDR halves, both regimes) + cross-domain
   instrument report — the R2 baseline number for current B/BHdr.
   Artifact: `benchmarks/upiq_crossdomain_baseline_<date>.md`. (tid2013 leg
   labeled integrity-guard; live leg is the headline.)
2. **TM-bridge corpus + baseline measurement** (no training): ultrahdr TM +
   1–2 simple operators over a stratified subset (e.g. 1–2k pairs), cvvdp
   dual-display scoring via existing fleet machinery. Artifact: §-doc with
   the misalignment decomposition. Gates proposed here get REGISTERED
   before any lever is fit.
3. **Joint spline co-calibration** (cheap lever, rank-invariant) if step
   1–2 show a systematic seam. Artifact: co-calibrated bake pair + before/
   after instrument numbers.
4. **Next BHdr head registration** adds: SDR-distillation term (R1) +
   bridge-consistency term (R3) with pre-registered gates on the
   instruments from 1–2 (+ the standing UPIQ-HDR confirmation discipline).
5. **Human currency** (parallel track): Bet2 triplet ingest against
   BTC-PTC-24 format (serves AIC-HDR2025 on release day + our own HDR
   triplet study on imazen-26 captures — the only path to owned human-HDR
   supervision; §8.15 says synthetic breadth cannot substitute).

## 6. Honest caveats

- UPIQ-SDR's tid2013 leg overlaps training → guard-grade only; live-779 is
  the clean SDR leg (n modest; CI-report everything).
- UPIQ-HDR burn ledger stands — steps 1–3 don't touch it; step 4's
  confirmation uses it ONCE per registration, as always.
- TM choice injects its own prior; that's why ≥2 operators and a
  teacher-explained-divergence formulation rather than raw invariance.
- cvvdp as the Δ-visibility teacher inherits cvvdp's own HDR biases
  (JOD 6..10 band compression at HQ); acceptable for a CONSISTENCY signal,
  not as an absolute target (that lesson is already paid for — twice).
- LIVE image files may not be on disk yet (scores are; check
  `upiq_extracted` coverage before step 1 and pull LIVE release if needed).

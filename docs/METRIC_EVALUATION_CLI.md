# Evaluate metric implementations on explicit datasets

`panel evaluate` runs dataset-independent diagnostics using the same statistics
as `panel` and `bake_verdict`. It accepts stored scores, keyed score tables,
external executables, batch executables, and the `zenmetrics score` CLI. It
writes JSON, Markdown, HTML, scored rows, and retained executable stdout/stderr.
It neither fits a metric nor discovers or opens default corpora.

```sh
cargo build --release -p zensim-validate --bin panel
target/release/panel evaluate --manifest examples/metric-evaluation/suite.json \
  --output /path/to/new-report-directory
```

The output directory must be new. Exit 0 means the requested computation
completed and any declared requirements passed; exit 1 means a scorer,
instrument or requirement failed, or a requirement was unmeasured; exit 2 means
invalid input or an execution/setup error. Without requirements the report is
diagnostic, not a pass certificate. Read coverage and individual criterion
states. Neither this report nor an attached instrument establishes production
qualification automatically.

The checked-in synthetic suite is self-contained. `just metric-evaluate-tests`
exercises real CLI invocations, including direction, keyed joins, Parquet,
external command failures, Zenmetrics multi-output selection and stale evidence.

## Dataset and metric contract

The manifest is `metric-evaluation-v1`, with nonempty `datasets` and `metrics`.
Paths resolve relative to the manifest; image paths in a table resolve relative
to that table. Executables use explicit paths, not PATH lookup. Each dataset
pins its exact file SHA256 and declares its role (`synthetic`, `train`, `eval`,
or `public_test`). Those declarations do not replace the dataset owner's
admission or authorize protected reads. Use the existing split/exposure rules.

CSV (including quoted fields), TSV and Parquet support named column mappings.
Only explicitly mapped Parquet columns are read. `id` is required and unique;
row order is preserved. Map arbitrary source headings to these names:

| Canonical column | Enables / meaning |
|---|---|
| `target` | Full rank panel and scatter; requires `target_kind` (`human`, `objective`, `synthetic`) |
| `reference_id` | Within-reference rank; separate from an image filename if needed |
| `content`, `codec`, `band` | Separate ranking panels |
| `sigma` | Positive per-stimulus standard deviation for normalized error |
| `quality`, `codec`, `reference_id` | Adjacent-rung dial diagnostics; dataset must declare `quality_direction` |
| `reference`, `distorted` | Original files for per-pair executable adapters |
| `pixel_sha256` | Optional known identical-pixel rungs; absence never means pixel equality |
| `right_id`, `choice`, `preference_group`, optional `weight` | Preference responses; current row is left, `right_id` names the other row. `choice` names the **more distorted** side (`left` or `right`), matching the existing pairwise owner. Empty right/choice cells have no response. |
| `severity_code`, `reference_id` | Existing five-level KADIS ramp owner: `type*10+level`, including its signed-type folding. This is a specific instrument encoding, not a generic severity scale. |
| `corruption_label` | Existing legacy corruption-ordering instrument: `ref__family__region__severity__corruption`, with corresponding `__q20` and `__q10` anchors. This is not an integrity detector qualification. |

Any additional mapped name can hold a metric's stored score. Missing/invalid
scores remain recorded and fail the assessment; no survivor-only correlations
are emitted. Invalid labels or ambiguous/duplicate keys are errors. A table can
have no target: human agreement then remains unmeasured rather than using a
quality setting or another metric as a human label.

Metric `direction` is required (`higher` or `lower`). `target_direction` defaults
to `higher`; set it to `lower` for DMOS/distortion targets. Signed quality-aligned
Spearman, Kendall, fitted Pearson and raw Pearson remain visible alongside the
legacy magnitude statistics. Direction is declared before scoring, never inferred
from observed correlation. `implementation` and `input_contract` describe the
build/model and pixel/color/display interpretation. `artifacts` optionally pins
model, script and configuration dependencies by path and SHA256; the executable
itself is hashed automatically. A wrapper must declare dependencies it uses.

The canonical merged quality-band method needs explicit `target_range: [lo,hi]`.
Its existing sample-size and target-span floors remain unchanged. The raw
scatter diagnostic uses the complete population; no plotting sample determines
tail statistics. `difference_threshold` optionally enables the existing DS-AUC
proxy in target units; it is not a measured human JND threshold. That owner
retains its deterministic pair subsampling at large populations.

`ladder_epsilon` belongs to each metric and is in that metric's native score
units. It must be explicit for dial diagnostics. The same rung classifier is
used by `bake_verdict`. These generic ladders report single-reference ordering,
range and dead zones. They do not infer encoder-attributed reversals or apply
Zensim's 0–100 calibration and mentor-floor thresholds to arbitrary metrics.

Full PWRC has quadratic cost. `max_panel_rows` defaults to 10000: larger rank
panels remain explicitly unmeasured. Increase it deliberately with an adequate
memory budget; this option never samples or truncates rows. Within-reference,
scatter, score retention and other applicable diagnostics still operate on all
rows. Run substantial evaluations through the normal resource-limited runner.

## Scoring adapters

Stored column, in the dataset's canonical column mapping:

```json
{"kind":"column", "column":"ssim2"}
```

Separate CSV/TSV/Parquet table, joined by exact row ID rather than position:

```json
{"kind":"table", "path":"scores.csv", "sha256":"<file SHA256>",
 "id_column":"image_name", "score_column":"score"}
```

Extra/duplicate IDs refuse; missing/invalid IDs produce failed score rows.

External executable: stdout is one JSON value; stderr is retained separately.
Arguments are passed literally without a shell. Available placeholders are
`{id}`, `{reference}`, `{distorted}`. Input files are hashed and kept unchanged;
the adapter owns decoding and its declared input contract.

```json
{"kind":"command", "program":"/path/to/metric-adapter",
 "args":["--reference","{reference}","--distorted","{distorted}"],
 "json_pointer":"/score", "timeout_seconds":120}
```

A numeric JSON root uses an empty pointer. A nonzero process exit, missing score,
nonfinite score, timeout or excessive output fails the row. Output limit is
1 MiB per stream; the timeout kills the direct process. Adapters must wait for
and clean up their own subprocesses. Per-process wall times include startup,
decoding and instrumentation; they are not qualified metric latency.

The Zenmetrics adapter uses its existing JSON score protocol:

```json
{"kind":"zenmetrics", "program":"/path/to/zenmetrics",
 "metric":"ssim2", "args":[], "timeout_seconds":120}
```

For multi-output metrics set `score_column` to the exact emitted key. Ambiguous
outputs refuse. Additional `args` preserve implementation-specific options such
as display selection. An available metric depends on the supplied binary's build;
use its `list-metrics` command. No metric names, versions or color conversions are
substituted. For native HDR use an adapter around the appropriate existing HDR
owner and declare its actual input contract; an SDR score invocation is not HDR
qualification.

For expensive initialization, use `batch_command` once per dataset:

```json
{"kind":"batch_command", "command":{
 "program":"/path/to/batch-adapter", "args":["{dataset}"],
 "timeout_seconds":600}}
```

It returns `{"scores":[{"id":"row-key","score":42.0}, ...]}`. Joins obey the
same strict keyed-table rules. The adapter reads the source table according to
its documented contract; it must not infer target labels or use them for fitting.
For large outputs, precompute a keyed score table instead of exceeding the JSON
output limit.

## Specialized instruments and requirements

Spatial intervention, RD, targeting, integrity, HDR, runtime and correctness
need information beyond image-pair scalar scores. Each appears as
`not_measured` unless a corresponding instrument is supplied. Reuse the owners
in [the playbook](WAVE_PLAYBOOK.md#one-owner-per-task); an arbitrary metric needs
an adapter implementing that instrument's capability.

An `instruments` entry selects `metric`, `dataset`, `criterion`, and either:

- `kind: "artifact"`, `path`, `sha256`, or
- `kind: "command"`, `command` (same executable protocol).

An instrument command receives placeholders `{dataset}`, `{scores}`,
`{metric_sha256}`, `{dataset_sha256}`, `{dataset_contract_sha256}`, `{criterion}`. Its JSON must be:

```json
{
  "schema":"metric-instrument-v1", "criterion":"targeting",
  "metric_sha256":"<run binding>", "dataset_sha256":"<run binding>",
  "dataset_contract_sha256":"<run binding>",
  "n":100, "measurements":{"p95_absolute_error":2.3}
}
```

The binding is recorded in `report.json`. The metric hash covers its complete
configuration, executable identity and declared dependencies. The dataset hash
covers the exact input table; the dataset-contract hash also binds mappings,
direction, ranges and role. Per-image input hashes accompany scored rows;
inputs are checked again after per-pair execution.
Stale bindings refuse. Artifact hashes protect bytes, not the scientific validity
of a claim: retain the measuring owner's underlying evidence and contract. A
claimed `pass` field is never imported as a decision.

Acceptance is explicit in `requirements`; no global composite invents weights
or hides missing capabilities:

```json
{"metric":"candidate", "dataset":"test", "criterion":"rank",
 "pointer":"/srocc_signed", "min":0.90}
```

Pointers are relative to `measurements`. Supply `min`, `max`, or both. Undefined,
missing or unmeasured values produce `incomplete`, never pass. Registered product
requirements must retain their existing values; generic thresholds do not replace
[the production contract](MODEL_SELECTION_SCORECARD.md).

Optional `comparisons` entries name `dataset`, `a`, `b`, `bootstrap_resamples`
and `seed`. They reuse the existing paired decisive-comparison owner. Its
bootstrap unit is a row, not a source cluster; reports label that limitation.
An inverted/undefined signed correlation refuses this polarity-tolerant legacy
comparison rather than turning reversed quality into a competitive model.

## AIC2026 preliminary release

[The dataset](https://doi.org/10.18419/DARUS-6156) provides decoded images,
bitstreams, cropped stimuli and objective metric tables. Its
[paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2607.22783v1) describes subjective scores as future
work. `JND_CVVDP` and the other metric-derived JND columns are **objective
estimates**, not human responses. Keep human-ranking capability unmeasured
unless an independently supplied subjective table is identified and admitted.

`scripts/inspect_metric_dataset.py ROOT --extract --report NEW.json` extracts
completed ZIP files into separate directories, validates CRCs, refuses differing
existing files, and inventories every Markdown/CSV while preserving hyperlinks.
Incomplete downloads are untouched. It discovers new completed ZIPs between
passes; rerun with a new report after a later download finishes. Inspection and
extraction confer no training permission.

Prepare a suite beside your own report directories:

```sh
python3 scripts/prepare_aic2026_evaluation.py /path/to/AIC2026 \
  --output /path/to/suite.json
target/debug/panel evaluate --manifest /path/to/suite.json \
  --output /path/to/new-report
```

This selects supplied CVVDP, SSIMULACRA2 and proposal-Butteraugli columns,
keeping cropped/full-resolution tables separate. It declares no target and
uses epsilon zero for strict ladder direction, not a perceptual materiality
threshold. Add `--objective-target CVVDP` when preparing a *separate* suite to
measure agreement with that objective teacher; the teacher itself is excluded
from the candidate list. These correlations are not human agreement.

`examples/metric-evaluation/imagemagick_psnr.py` is a small real external
adapter. Invoke it through an explicit Python executable, with arguments
`["/path/to/imagemagick_psnr.py", "--magick", "/path/to/magick",
"--reference", "{reference}", "--distorted", "{distorted}"]` and
`json_pointer: "/score"`. Pin the script and ImageMagick binary in `artifacts`.
It checks dimensions, accepts ImageMagick's differing-image exit status,
and refuses infinite PSNR. It uses ImageMagick's default pixel interpretation;
it does not reproduce AIC2026's supplied PSNR-Y implementation.

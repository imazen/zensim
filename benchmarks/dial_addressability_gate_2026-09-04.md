# G-ADDR — the dial ADDRESSABILITY gate (PRE-REGISTERED 2026-09-04)

**Lane:** `claude-dialgate`.
**User rule (2026-09-04), verbatim spirit:** *"floor and ceiling dial addressability is
crucial … any model that limits dial range cannot ship"*, and *"I want to be able to reuse

**Owner:** `zensim-validate/src/dial_addressability.rs` (registry
`benchmarks/dial_addressability_floor_2026-09-04.json`, embedded with `include_str!`),
wired into `bake_verdict`'s DIAL panel and emitted at `dial.addressability` in
`--full-json`.

## 0. Headline

**No candidate passes. `B dial-era v2` is NOT proposed.** Three bars block the leading arms,
and all three are now measured rather than argued:

- **A4** (`p5 ≤ 13.645`) is **not attainable by any output spline on B's ordering**. An
  ORACLE arm — the eval grid itself as the anchor with the ssim2 truth as target — reads
  `p5` **21.5–22.8** across a 10× knot sweep, *further* from the bar than every real
  candidate (17.7–18.6). Shipped B clears it by mapping the low band **below** its
  conditional median: on the 221 lowest-truth cells it is +23.27 off the truth, the best
  candidate +22.80, the oracle +27.09. **Profile D reads `p5 = 9.52`** on the same
  instrument, so the bar IS reachable — by different weights, not by a different spline.
- **A1 / A3 / A6** (`max`, `p95`, `dynamic_range`) sit **ABOVE the reference metric's own
  values on the same grid** — truth `max` 98.38 / `p95` 95.46 / DR 85.20 against bars
  99.98 / 99.72 / 86.08. A dial calibrated exactly to the truth fails all three, and both
  other shipped profiles (A and D) do. Those bars encode the incumbent's *stretch* at the
  ceiling, not its reach.
- **C2 ⊻ C6 is a MODEL defect with a proof.** 266 of 4,424 dial-grid cells (6.01 %) have a
  raw prediction ABOVE the identity vector's — B ranks 6 % of lossy output better than a
  perfect copy. Pin identity at 100 and they cap (C2 fails, measured: 267 cells at exactly
  100.00); leave identity below 100 and they out-score it (C5/C6 fail). Monotonicity admits
  no third option. The weights must change.

**What the lane did establish:** two arms (`ne12_ss_unc_id100`, `ss_unc_id100_lowband`) that
are **rank-identical to shipped B**, retain **79 % / 77 %** of the era correction, calibrate
better than shipped on the whole grid (MAE 4.29 / 4.37 vs **5.45**), and **fix four of the
shipped dial's standing contract defects** — the dial goes genuinely negative on
negative-truth input for the first time, identity reads exactly 100, and nothing out-scores
a perfect copy. Plus: a **codec-specific ssim2 reuse rule** (§7), the first measurement of
what the **truth** says the dial's ends should read (§8), and the CID22 contamination audit
of both anchors — **0 hits at d ≤ 10** (§12).

---

## 1. Why a new gate

`benchmarks/imazen26_anchor_2026-09-04.md` established that shipped **B**'s −5..−6 point
dial skew is an **era** term: re-anchoring the SAME 2,000 anchor rows read today recovers
+3.892 (CID22) / +4.798 (KonJND) / +3.864 (AIC-3), 78–82 % of the defect, with SROCC
identical to 5 dp. But every candidate that recovers it **loses reach**:

| | shipped | `B_safesyn_curera` | `B_im26anchor` | `B_im26topdense` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| reach | 96.85 | 94.23 | 85.74 | 88.96 |
| p5 | 13.73 | 18.23 | 22.91 | 22.99 |
| dynamic range | 85.99 | 81.33 | 75.53 | 76.13 |

Under the user's rule none of those can ship. **Nothing in the existing eval sees this.**
SROCC is rank-invariant and therefore *structurally* blind to it (all five arms read
0.88212 on CID22). G3 is about ordering. G1 asks only `p5 ≤ 25 ∧ p95 ≥ 85` — a bar every
one of the compressed arms clears comfortably. So a dial can lose 11 points of reach and
every panel in the mandatory two-panel eval will call it fine.

G-ADDR is the missing measurement.

## 2. The two tiers — and why they must not be merged

| tier | bar | question |
|---|---|---|
| **REGRESSION** (`A1`–`A9`) | the SHIPPED dial's own value on the SAME instrument | *is this candidate worse at the ends than the dial users have today?* |
| **CONTRACT** (`C1`–`C6`) | absolute product requirements | *does this dial meet the product contract at all?* |

They are separate because **the shipped dial fails four contract rows today** (§4). Merging
them would make every candidate's report say "FAIL" for reasons it did not cause. Every
report therefore prints an `incumbent` column: what the shipped dial reads on that same
axis. A ship needs **both** tiers PASS.

`—` is **NOT MEASURED**, never a pass. An unregistered dial grid makes the whole regression
tier `NOT MEASURABLE` — a bar you can dodge by choosing a friendlier instrument is not a
bar.

## 3. The bars

Instrument: the **canonical** dial grid
`dial_grid_372col_2026-05-29_quarantined_v2.parquet`, sha `6546c43e6d9572dc…`, 4,424 rows.
(The non-canonical `_quarantined` grid that `imazen26_anchor_2026-09-04.md` measured on is
*also* registered, with its own row, so those published numbers stay checkable against
their own instrument. New work uses the canonical one.)

### REGRESSION tier — bar = shipped B on the same instrument

| id | axis | direction | bar (canonical grid) | bar (doc grid `b5d27f21…`) |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| A1 | ceiling — pooled dial `max` | ≥ | **99.98330778475787** | 99.98376794026095 |
| A2 | floor — pooled dial `min` | ≤ | **3.12950123756248** | 3.12950123756248 |
| A3 | robust ceiling — `p95` | ≥ | **99.72170874183841** | 99.71524151863066 |
| A4 | robust floor — `p5` | ≤ | **13.645032446453126** | 13.726111774203428 |
| A5 | `reach` = max − min | ≥ | **96.85380654719539** | 96.85426670269847 |
| A6 | `dynamic_range` = p95 − p5 | ≥ | **86.07667629538528** | 85.98912974442723 |
| A7 | negative-tail probe dial `min` | ≤ | **2.516685884084839** | (probe is grid-independent) |
| A8 | negative-tail probe dial `p1` | ≤ | **3.981383254902343** | — |
| A9 | negative-tail `frac_below_zero` | ≥ | **0.0** | — |

A4's bar on the doc grid (13.7261) and A5/A6 reproduce the imazen-26 record's `p5 13.73 /
reach 96.85 / DR 85.99` exactly, which is the cross-check that this gate measures the same
quantity that record does.

### CONTRACT tier — absolute

| id | axis | bar | provenance |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | monotonicity | ≥ 0.93 | registered G3, `docs/EVAL_PANEL_REQUIREMENT.md` |
| C2 | flat/clamp dead-zone | ≤ 0.05 | registered G3 |
| C3 | negative values WORK — `frac_below_zero` on an all-negative-truth probe | > 0 | CLAUDE.md *"NEGATIVE zensim values MUST work … do NOT clamp at 0"* |
| C4 | deepest probe dial | < 0 | same |
| C5 | `dial(ref==dist)` inside `[97.5, 100]` | 0 rows outside | `benchmarks/standard_bake_packing_2026-05-27.md` + the QAT record |
| C6 | dial-grid cells out-scoring a perfect copy | 0 | *"0 above-identity"*, same record |

## 4. The instruments (pinned, content-addressed)

**`negtail_probe_372_2026-09-04.parquet`** — sha `5609d19fa10aef81…`, 2,000 rows,
`/mnt/v/output/zensim/dialgate-2026-09-04/`. Cut from
`canonical-2026-07-15/train/kadis_negrich.parquet` (266,111 rows, 237,675 with
`ssim2_gpu < 0`) by **20 equal-count quantile bins over the negative population, lowest 100
row indices per bin** — deterministic, no RNG. Truth span `ssim2_gpu` −770.62 … −0.33;
**every row's reference metric is negative**, so a correct dial must go below zero somewhere
on it. Current era (extracted 2026-07-15, after both extractor fixes).

**`identity_probe_372_2026-09-04.parquet`** — sha `e6f9096b8e0ebd97…`, 38 rows. All 38
distinct reference images of the canonical dial grid, each paired with **itself**, extracted
by `extract_features_372col` through imazen decoders at this lane's HEAD.

> **MEASURED, and it changed the design: the identity feature vector is the ZERO vector, for
> every image.** All 38 rows come back byte-identical and all-zero — which is what a
> *difference* metric must do, and it makes the identity dial a **scalar property of the
> bake**, `dial(0⃗)`, not a per-image measurement. The probe is kept at 38 rows rather than
> 1 so that property stays gated instead of assumed.

Measured identity dial across the shipped bakes:

| bake | `dial(0⃗)` | inside [97.5, 100]? |
|---|---:|---|
| `v47_strict_qat_native_2026-05-27` (Profile A) | **97.6893** | ✓ |
| `b_sdr_linear_cid80_inclwinsor_dense_dial_2026-07-07` (Profile B, SHIPPED) | **96.2412** | ✗ |
| `d_sdr_add156_dense_dial_2026-08-31` (Profile D) | **96.1157** | ✗ |

So `[97.5, 100]` is a **v47-era** property; both shipped LINEAR dials sit ~1.3 points below
it. Registered as specified and **not relaxed** — the incumbent's failure is a finding.

## 5. Where the incumbent stands — the gate's first reading

`bake_verdict --bake <shipped B> --dial-grid <canonical> --negtail-probe … --identity-probe …`

**`NOT SHIPPABLE — regression PASS / contract FAIL`**, 11 pass / 4 fail / 0 not measured.
Regression is a tie by construction (the bars are its own values, and the comparators are
inclusive — a dedicated test pins that). The four contract failures are **standing defects
in the shipped product dial**:

| id | shipped B reads | bar |
|---|---:|---|
| C3 negative values work | `frac_below_zero` **0.0000** on a probe whose every row's truth is negative | > 0 |
| C4 deepest tail dial | **+2.5167** | < 0 |
| C5 identity band | **96.2412** (38/38 rows outside) | [97.5, 100] |
| C6 nothing above identity | **266 of 4,424 cells (6.01 %)** out-score a perfect copy; worst `1a20ecb0c1b92466_1022x818` jxl d=0.05 at **99.9833** vs identity **96.2412** | 0 |

**Read C3/C4 together with the floor mechanism.** Shipped B's dial anchor
(`multiband_anchor_dial100.parquet`) stores `target_score = max(ssim2, 0)`. 147 of its 2,000
rows have a genuinely negative ssim2 — down to **−64.16** — and **every one is stored as
0**. `dial_spline::fit_spline_knots` then collapses that run of `y == 0` bins to a single
bottom knot (the `neg_tail` dedup), so the spline carries **no in-distribution evidence at
all** about how far below zero the dial should go; the whole negative tail is a linear
extrapolation off one knot, and it extrapolates to `+2.52` on inputs whose truth is −770.

That is also why a *pure* re-anchor fails A4 by construction: the era correction is a
near-uniform **+3.9…+4.8** lift, so the floor rises with everything else and the clamp is
the reason nothing pushes back. **The lever is the clamp, not the anchor.**

## 6. Gate implementation — what landed

- `zensim-validate/src/dial_addressability.rs` — the owner: registry reader, `GridMeasure` /
  `NegTailMeasure` / `IdentityMeasure`, `evaluate`, markdown + JSON renderers. 12 tests.
- `benchmarks/dial_addressability_floor_2026-09-04.json` — the append-only registry.
- `bake_verdict` — new `--negtail-probe` / `--identity-probe`; the DIAL panel now emits the
  G-ADDR section on **every** run; `--full-json` carries `dial.addressability` (verdict +
  every raw measurement) and `dial.min` / `dial.max`.
- Test `canonical_dial_grid_has_a_g_addr_floor_row` pins the registry to `bake_verdict`'s
  own `CANONICAL_DIAL_GRID_SHA256`, so rotating the canonical grid without measuring the
  reference on it fails the build instead of silently disarming the gate.

**A one-ULP defect found and fixed on the way.** `serde_json`'s default float parser is not
correctly rounded: the bar written as the shipped dial's own `99.98330778475787` parsed back
as `…788`, and the reference bake **failed its own bar by one ULP** (A1 and A5 read ✗ in the
first run). Fixed by enabling serde_json's `float_roundtrip` feature for `zensim-validate`
(parsing only — serialization already goes through ryu), with
`registry_floats_round_trip_bit_exactly` as the guard. Worth knowing beyond this gate:
**every float bar `freeze_check` reads out of a fulleval JSON had the same hazard.**

# RESULTS

## 7. ssim2 reuse across decoder eras — MEASURED, and the answer is CODEC-SPECIFIC

**Question (user):** *"I want to be able to reuse ssim2 scores if possible."* Both anchors'
`target_score` is a **stored** ssim2 computed at the corpus's own decode era, while the
features beside it are decoded today — the "mixed-era caveat" §2c of the imazen-26 record
refused to paper over.

**Method.** Both anchors' pairs re-scored with `zenmetrics batch --metric ssim2` — imazen
`fast-ssim2` through the umbrella's `cpu-ssim2`, decode by imazen codecs — on **today's**
bytes, against the stored value. (`zenmetrics`'s prebuilt CLI had no JXL decoder; it was
rebuilt at its default feature set, which restores jpeg/webp/avif/jxl. Its `--metric ssim2`
help text still says "via the `ssimulacra2` crate" — read from source, the CPU path routes
through `zenmetrics_api`'s `cpu-ssim2` = **`fast-ssim2`**, i.e. imazen. The help text is
stale, the dispatch is not.)

| anchor | n | stored col | median \|Δ\| | p95 | p99 | max | frac \|Δ\| > 0.5 | SROCC | PLCC |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| shipped safesyn `multiband_anchor_dial100` | 2,000 | `ssim2_gpu` | 0.0534 | 0.983 | 2.103 | 5.130 | **11.30 %** | 0.99984 | 0.99991 |
| imazen-26 `imazen26_multiband_anchor_dial100` | 4,000 | `score_ssim2` | 0.0043 | 0.241 | 1.750 | 8.375 | **2.50 %** | 0.99989 | 0.99993 |

**Per codec — this is the whole finding:**

| safesyn family | n | median \|Δ\| | frac > 0.5 | mean signed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `zenwebp-default-m4` | 279 | 0.0134 | 0.36 % | +0.032 |
| `zenjxl-e7` | 210 | 0.0394 | 4.76 % | −0.073 |
| `mozjpeg-rs-420-e4` | 481 | 0.0403 | 2.08 % | +0.066 |
| `zenavif-s5-e6` | 372 | 0.0495 | 6.99 % | +0.070 |
| `zenjpeg-420-e2` | 373 | 0.0613 | 3.49 % | +0.093 |
| **`zenjpeg-420-xyb-e2`** | **285** | **0.6370** | **58.25 %** | **+0.632** |

| imazen-26 codec | n | median \|Δ\| | frac > 0.5 | mean signed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **`zenwebp`** | 1,000 | **0.0000** | **0.00 %** | +0.0000 |
| `zenjpeg` | 1,000 | 0.0082 | 0.20 % | −0.002 |
| `zenjxl` | 1,000 | 0.0409 | 3.80 % | −0.069 |
| `zenavif` | 1,000 | 0.0014 | 6.00 % | −0.021 (max 8.37) |

**The reuse rule, as measured.** Against the pre-registered decision rule ("reusable iff the
fraction past 0.5 is 0") the answer is **NO in aggregate** — 11.3 % / 2.5 % of rows move past
the dial's materiality — so both anchors below were **re-scored at their own decode era**,
which is what makes them single-era in features AND target and closes the imazen-26 record's
§2c caveat. But the aggregate hides the structure:

- **`zenwebp` re-scores to 0.0000 on 1,000 of 1,000 imazen-26 rows** — bit-exact. That also
  settles what the stored bigcodec `score_ssim2` column IS: the same CPU `fast-ssim2` path,
  not a GPU column, so for imazen-26 this measurement is a **pure decoder-era** term with no
  CPU/GPU confound.
- The safesyn drift is carried by **one family**: XYB JPEG (`zenjpeg-420-xyb-e2`), median
  0.637 and 58 % past materiality, against ≤ 0.061 and ≤ 7 % for every other family. That is
  the same family the retracted `image::open` probe stumbled over — the difference is that
  zenjpeg's XYB path genuinely evolved, which an imazen-only re-read can measure and a
  third-party decoder cannot see at all.
- The imazen-26 tail is **`zenavif`** (median 0.0014 but 6 % past 0.5, max 8.37), consistent
  with its manifest note that AVIF decodes to `Rgb16` and is flattened.

**Rule to carry forward:** a stored ssim2 target is reusable across decoder eras **per
codec** — bit-exact for zenwebp, immaterial for zenjpeg/mozjpeg/zenjxl — and is **NOT**
reusable for **XYB JPEG** or for **AVIF's tail**. Rank is untouched everywhere (SROCC ≥
0.9998), so a stored target is always safe for anything rank-based; it is the *absolute*
value that moves. Re-scoring 6,000 pairs cost 171 s of CPU, so when the bytes are on disk,
re-score.

## 8. What the truth says the dial should read — the reference nobody had measured

Before judging any candidate, the same instrument was measured with the **reference metric
itself**: `dialcells_ssim2_qv2grid.tsv` (2026-08-31) holds ssim2 for every one of the 4,424
canonical dial-grid cells. The dial's anchor target IS ssim2, so this is what a perfectly
calibrated dial would read.

| | min | p5 | median | p95 | max | reach | dyn. range | frac < 0 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **ssim2 TRUTH** | **−55.35** | **10.26** | 87.28 | **95.46** | **98.38** | **153.73** | **85.20** | **3.48 %** (154 cells) |
| shipped B | +3.13 | 13.65 | — | 99.72 | 99.98 | 96.85 | 86.08 | 0 |

Three things follow immediately, and they reframe two of the pre-registered bars:

1. **Shipped B's floor is not merely compressed, it is absent.** 154 grid cells have a
   genuinely negative ssim2 and B scores **every one of them positive**, bottoming out at
   +3.13 where the truth reaches −55.35.
2. **Shipped B's `dynamic_range` (86.08) is LARGER than the truth's own (85.20).** A dial
   calibrated exactly to the truth would **fail bar A6**. A6 is therefore not a reachable
   addressability bar; it is a bar the incumbent clears by stretching.
3. **Shipped B's p5 (13.65) is 3.4 points ABOVE the truth's (10.26)** — so the incumbent is
   not "more addressable" at p5 either; it is closer to the truth there than the candidates,
   but for a reason §10 shows is miscalibration rather than reach.

**And the same is true at the ceiling.** The truth's `max` is 98.38 and its `p95` 95.46;
shipped B reads 99.98 and 99.72 — **+1.6 and +4.3 above the reference metric**. So bars A1,
A3 and A6 all sit ABOVE the truth's own values on this grid. They encode the incumbent's
*stretch*, not its reach, and **a dial calibrated exactly to the truth would fail all three**.
A2 / A5 / A7-A9 (the floor and tail axes) are the ones where the incumbent is genuinely
short of the truth, by an enormous margin, and those are the axes the candidates fix.

### 8a. Running the gate on the OTHER shipped profiles — the cross-check that settles it

Same grid, same probes, zero extra work (the gate runs on every `bake_verdict` invocation):

| profile | reach | min | max | p5 | p95 | DR | tied | negtail min | frac<0 | identity | above-id | fails |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **B** (SHIPPED SDR) | 96.85 | 3.13 | 99.98 | 13.65 | 99.72 | 86.08 | .0000 | +2.52 | .0000 | 96.24 | 266 | C3 C4 C5 C6 |
| **A** `v47_strict_qat_native` | 113.90 | −17.11 | 96.78 | 16.67 | 94.51 | 77.85 | .0000 | **−93.90** | **.5575** | **97.69** | **0** | A1 A3 A4 A6 |
| **D** `d_sdr_add156_dense_dial` | 108.25 | −12.20 | 96.05 | **9.52** | 95.28 | 85.77 | .0000 | **−100.00** | **.8580** | 96.12 | **0** | A1 A3 A6 C5 |
| ssim2 TRUTH | 153.73 | −55.35 | 98.38 | 10.26 | 95.46 | 85.20 | — | — | — | — | — | — |

Three things this settles:

- **Profile A is the only bake measured here that passes the ENTIRE CONTRACT tier** —
  identity 97.6893 in band, 0 cells above identity, and a negative tail that actually works
  (55.75 % of the all-negative-truth probe scores below zero, min −93.90). The QAT-era dial
  was right about all four things the shipped SDR dial gets wrong.
- **A4 is reachable — by a DIFFERENT MODEL.** Profile D reads `p5 = 9.52`, comfortably under
  the 13.645 bar and within 0.7 of the truth's 10.26. §10.1's impossibility is therefore
  precisely scoped: it is unattainable *for B's raw ordering*, and the residual is a weights
  limitation, now demonstrated rather than inferred.
- **A1 / A3 / A6 are the mirror image**: both A and D fail all three, and both sit BELOW the
  truth at the top while B sits above it. Only the incumbent clears bars that the reference
  metric itself does not.

## 9. The candidates — all rank-identical, and four of the incumbent's contract defects fixed

Every arm shares **identical weights, scaler and winsor guards**; only the output spline
differs. **CID22 SROCC is 0.88212 on every single arm** (KonJND −0.51938, AIC-3 0.76501, TID
0.77852, KADID 0.80847) — rank invariance verified, not assumed. Chain control: rebuilding
`B_safesyn_curera` through this lane's driver reproduces the imazen-26 lane's bake
**BYTE-IDENTICALLY** (sha `c414b3f91da83e69…`).

Measured on the canonical dial grid + both probes (bars in §3; **bold** = fails):

**What each mechanism bought, isolated:**

- **Unclamping the anchor target** (keeping the 145 genuinely-negative rows instead of
  `max(ssim2, 0)`) moves the fitted spline's bottom from `y = 0.0` to `y = −18.2` and is the
  whole of the floor fix: grid `min` 5.75 → 1.96 (**A2 passes**), `reach` 94.23 → 98.01
  (**A5 passes**), negtail `min` 5.04 → 0.35 (**A7**), `p1` 6.69 → 3.95 (**A8**). It changes
  nothing else — same `p5`, same `p95`, same mono.
- **Anchoring the identity rows at 100** puts the spline's top knot at `(raw(0⃗), 100)`:
  `max` and `p95` reach exactly 100 (**A1, A3 pass**), the identity dial becomes **100.0000**
  (**C5 passes**) and **0** cells out-score a perfect copy (**C6 passes**) — the first time
  either has held. It costs `tied` 0.0000 → **0.0567**, which fails C2 (see §10.3).
- **Coarsening the knot grid to `n_edges = 12`** deepens the tail further (`min` 1.88 →
  −2.70, negtail `frac<0` 0 → 1.35 %, **C3 and C4 pass**) — the first arms in this whole
  lineage where a negative-truth input actually scores negative.
- **A low band** (1,000 kadis-negative rows, quantile-stratified and **disjoint from the
  negtail probe**, targets unclamped) deepens it much further: negtail `min` −11.68, `p1`
  −6.45, `frac<0` **6.60 %**, grid `min` −9.39, `reach` **109.39**.
- **imazen-26 as the anchor corpus REGRESSES the floor badly** — grid `min` +11.91, negtail
  `min` +11.64, `p5` 22.11 — and mixing it in drags the safesyn arms' floor back up. The
  imazen-26 record's own reach warning is confirmed and localised: it is a *low-band
  coverage* deficit, not a top-end one.

**Era correction retained.** Mean per-pair dial shift vs shipped B (100 % of pairs move by
more than 0.5 on every corpus):

| arm | CID22 | KonJND | AIC-3 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `ctl_curera` (the record's arm) | +3.923 | +4.826 | +3.892 |
| **(b′)** `ne12_ss_unc_id100` | **+3.947** | **+4.498** | **+3.912** |
| **(b″)** `ss_unc_id100_lowband` | +3.729 | +4.744 | +3.686 |
| `mix_unc_id100_lowband` | +3.368 | +3.955 | +3.439 |

against the −4.977 / −5.857 era defect — i.e. the leading candidates still recover
**79 % / 77 %** of it, the same as the plain re-anchor, while also fixing four contract rows.

## 10. Why NO candidate passes — the precise impossibility, per axis

Three bars remain unmet by the best arms: **A4** (`p5 ≤ 13.6450`), **A6** (`dynamic_range ≥
86.0767`) and **C2** (`tied ≤ 0.05`). Each is now measured, not argued.

### 10.1 A4 — unattainable by any output spline ON B'S ORDERING (a different model reaches it)

An **ORACLE** arm was built to bound the question: the dial grid *itself* as the anchor, with
the **ssim2 truth** as the target — i.e. train-on-test, the best a monotone re-map of B's own
ordering can do. It is a diagnostic and can never ship; its only job is to bound A4.

| n_edges | 12 | 18 | 30 | 60 | 120 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| candidate `ss_unc_id100` p5 | 18.63 | 17.92 | 17.73 | 18.17 | 18.17 |
| **ORACLE p5** | — | **21.75** | **22.53** | **22.77** | **22.66** |

**The oracle is FURTHER from the bar than every candidate, at every knot count.** A monotone
map must assign one dial value per raw value, so the best it can do in a bin is that bin's
conditional median — and in the bin holding the 5th percentile of B's predictions that median
is ~22. The knot sweep (candidate d) moves `p5` by 0.9 points across a 10× range of knot
counts; it is not the lever.

The reason is visible in the low band. On the 221 lowest-truth cells (**mean truth −11.30**):

| arm | mean dial there | bias vs truth | MAE (low 5 %) | MAE (all 4,424 cells) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ssim2 truth | −11.30 | — | — | — |
| shipped B | +11.97 | **+23.27** | 23.31 | **5.45** |
| `ctl_curera` | +15.39 | +26.68 | 26.69 | 4.35 |
| `ne12_ss_unc_id100` | +13.66 | +24.95 | 25.00 | **4.29** |
| `ss_unc_id100_lowband` | **+11.50** | **+22.80** | **23.08** | 4.37 |
| **ORACLE** | +15.80 | **+27.09** | 27.13 | **4.17** |

**Read the last two columns together.** The oracle has the best whole-grid calibration
(MAE 4.17) *and* the worst low-band bias (+27.09) — because the model's raw prediction does
not separate those cells at all, so any honest monotone map hands them the conditional
median. `ss_unc_id100_lowband` reaches +22.80, **better than shipped B's +23.27 and better
than the oracle's**, which is as far as an output spline can go. Every candidate beats
shipped B on whole-grid MAE (4.29–4.37 vs **5.45**).

So shipped B's `p5 = 13.65` is not addressability — it is the low band mapped *below* its
conditional median. **A4 as pre-registered rewards that.** It is unattainable by a dial
change *on B's ordering*, and the residual is a **model (weights) limitation** — which §8a
demonstrates directly: **Profile D (`d_sdr_add156_dense_dial`) reads `p5 = 9.52`**, under the
bar and within 0.7 of the truth's 10.26, on the same grid with the same gate. A4 is a
reachable bar; B cannot reach it by re-splining.

### 10.2 A6 — the bar exceeds the truth's own dynamic range

`dynamic_range = p95 − p5`. With identity anchored at 100 the ceiling is exactly 100, so
A6 reduces to `p5 ≤ 13.923` — i.e. **A6 is A4 with a 0.28-point discount** and falls with it.
Independently: **the ssim2 truth's own dynamic range on this grid is 85.196, below the
86.077 bar.** A dial calibrated exactly to the truth fails A6. The bar measures stretch, not
reach.

### 10.3 C2 ⊻ C6 — a hard either/or created by the MODEL, not the dial

**266 of 4,424 dial-grid cells (6.01 %) have a raw prediction ABOVE the identity vector's** —
B ranks 6 % of *lossy* codec output better than a perfect copy. An output spline is monotone,
so it cannot reorder them. Exactly two outcomes exist:

- **Identity pinned at 100** (arms b, b′, b″): those cells hit the [0,100] cap. Measured:
  **267 of 4,424 cells sit exactly at 100.00** in both id100 arms — matching the 266 count —
  and the adjacent-rung ties they create are the entire `tied = 0.0567`. C5 and C6 pass;
  **C2 fails.**
- **Identity below 100** (shipped B, arms a, oracle): those cells spread above identity.
  `tied = 0.0000`; **C5 and C6 fail** (266 cells above identity, worst
  `1a20ecb0c1b92466_1022x818` jxl d=0.05 at 99.98 against identity 96.24).

Monotonicity forces `dial(identity) ≤ dial(cell)` whenever `raw(identity) ≤ raw(cell)`, so no
choice of knots satisfies both. **C2 and C6 cannot both pass while those 266 raw inversions
exist.** The fix is the weights, not the dial. (This is also the first time the defect has
been *counted*: 6.01 % of the grid, on the shipped product dial, today.)

## 11. Recommendation

**No candidate passes the full G-ADDR gate, so under the user's rule none may ship, and none
is proposed for the board.** `B dial-era v2` is NOT proposed. That is the honest answer and
the gate did its job on its first use.

What the lane established, in the order it matters:

1. **The bars that block the leading candidates are, in part, not addressability bars.**
   A4 is unattainable by any monotone dial *on B's ordering* (though Profile D reaches it —
   §8a — so it is a weights problem, not an unreachable bar); and **A1, A3 and A6 all sit
   ABOVE the reference metric's own values on the same grid** (truth `max` 98.38 / `p95`
   95.46 / DR 85.20 vs bars 99.98 / 99.72 / 86.08). A dial calibrated exactly to the truth
   fails all three, and both other shipped profiles do. **This is a finding about the
   pre-registration, not a request to relax it** — the bars stay exactly as written, no
   candidate was graded against anything softer, and the arms are reported as failing. The
   user's decision is whether to REPLACE the four *ceiling/spread* bars with ones a
   correctly-calibrated dial can meet: truth-referenced (`|dial end − truth end| ≤ δ`) or
   calibration-referenced (low-band and whole-grid MAE against the reference metric), both of
   which **every candidate already beats the incumbent on** (whole-grid MAE 4.29-4.37 vs
   5.45). The FLOOR bars (A2, A5, A7-A9) need no revision — they are the axes where the
   incumbent is genuinely short of the truth, and the candidates fix them.
2. **`ne12_ss_unc_id100`** (sha `2deeae9c…`) and **`ss_unc_id100_lowband`** (sha `ef4298ef…`)
   are the leading arms: rank-identical to shipped B, era correction retained (+3.9 / +4.5 /
   +3.9 and +3.7 / +4.7 / +3.7), whole-grid calibration better than shipped (MAE 4.29 / 4.37
   vs 5.45), **and they fix four of the incumbent's standing contract defects** — the dial
   goes genuinely negative on negative-truth input for the first time (C3, C4), identity
   reads exactly 100 (C5), and nothing out-scores a perfect copy (C6). They fail only A4, A6
   and C2.
3. **C2 vs C6 is a model defect with a proof.** 266 lossy cells out-rank a perfect copy in
   B's RAW space; no output spline can hold both bars. It needs a weights change, and it is
   now counted and named rather than latent.
4. **imazen-26 is the wrong anchor for the FLOOR.** Every imazen-26 arm regresses grid `min`
   to +11.9 and negtail `min` to +11.6. Its deficit is low-band coverage in prediction space,
   which is fixable by adding a low band — not by top-densification, which the imazen-26
   record had already found could not move `p5`.

**A note on other regimes.** A 720/944-input bake reads `regression NOT MEASURABLE` and
`contract INCOMPLETE`: its default dial grid is not in the registry and the 372-wide probes
refuse to score against it (both refusals print loudly on stderr). That is correct and
deliberate — registering a 944 grid needs a **shipped 944-class reference dial** to measure
the floor from, and none exists. Verified on `c_sdr_purity944_2026-08-29`: 2 pass, 0 fail,
13 not measured, no silent pass anywhere.

**Registered, not run:** (i) a non-kadis low band — `ss_unc_id100_lowband`'s low rows come
from `kadis_negrich`, disjoint from the negtail probe by construction but same-distribution,
so a ship-grade version wants a low band from the anchor's own corpora; (ii) wiring
`dial.addressability` into the gauntlet board (the JSON is emitted; nothing reads it yet);
(iii) the A4/A6 replacement above, which is a user decision.

## 12. CID22 contamination audit of the anchors — CLEAN at the strict threshold

The brief asked whether an audit of the imazen-26 anchor's origins against CID22's 49
validation references exists. **It did not.** `benchmarks/imazen26_holdout_audit_2026-08-25.json`
audits imazen-26 *ids* (verdict for `ext_cid22`: "clean — different id namespace") and
`benchmarks/imazen26_dhash_audit_2026-08-27.md` runs dHash against the picker corpus and
synthetic-v2, explicitly registering the cross-corpus dHash check as a follow-up. Run here,
for both anchors, with the owner:

```
check_holdout_overlap --cid22-refs /mnt/v/dataset/cid22/CID22_validation_set/original \
    --training-csv <anchor refs> --threshold 10
```

| anchor | distinct refs | flagged d ≤ 10 | d ≤ 16 (screen) | closest |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| imazen-26 anchor | 1,224 | **0** | 67 rows / **9 origins** | d=12 `o_1442` ~ CID22 `2887497.png` |
| shipped safesyn anchor | 1,495 | **0** | **0** | d=17 `09928cea53e5d8c9_1022x818` ~ `2887497.png` |

**Neither anchor has a single reference within the strict d ≤ 10 contamination threshold of
a CID22 validation reference.** The 9 imazen-26 origins in the d ≤ 16 *screening* tier are
reported, never quarantined, per the 2026-05-14 policy — a side-by-side review page (no image
processing, the originals as-is) is at
`/mnt/v/output/zensim/dialgate-2026-09-04/overlap-review/index.html`
(`http://localhost:3300/zensim/dialgate-2026-09-04/overlap-review/`). No action is proposed
and none should be taken without the user's eye pass.

# 14. Re-pin 2026-09-04 — the bars are the REFERENCE METRIC now

**USER DECISION, verbatim:** *"I don't think we should pin to B, ssim2 seems a better
mentor."*

**Landed:** owner `zensim-validate/src/dial_addressability.rs`, registry
`benchmarks/dial_addressability_floor_2026-09-04.json` (append-only), driver
`scripts/dialgate_arms.sh score`.

## 14.1 Why the incumbent was the wrong mentor

The gate's own first run measured its pins to be defective — not merely strict, but
pointing the wrong way. Both findings are in §8 and §10 and neither was known when the
bars were pre-registered:

1. **A1 / A3 / A6 sat ABOVE what the reference metric itself reaches on the same grid.**
   Truth `max` 98.3766 / `p95` 95.4593 / DR 85.1960 against bars 99.9833 / 99.7217 /
   86.0767. A dial calibrated *exactly to the truth* failed all three, and so did both
   other shipped profiles. Those bars encoded the incumbent's **stretch**, not its reach.
2. **A4 was met by B only through a −23-point low-band bias.** On the 221 lowest-truth
   cells B reads +11.97 where the truth is −11.30, and the train-on-test ORACLE — the
   ceiling for any monotone re-map of B's ordering — reads `p5` 21.5–22.8. B's low `p5`
   is the low band mapped *below* its conditional median; the old A4 rewarded exactly that.

A gate pinned to the incumbent therefore **barred candidates for being closer to the truth
than the incumbent is**. That is the failure the re-pin fixes.

## 14.2 What changed, precisely

Registry rows are now keyed **`(instrument, reference)`**, both halves load-bearing. The
`peer_ssim2` pin set was appended; the `shipped_b` set is **retained, printed as
`incumbent`, and never a bar** — labelled biased, with the two measured reasons above.
Pre-2026-09-04 rows carry no `reference` field and a serde default supplies one, so those
rows are **byte-untouched**, which is what append-only requires.

Direction semantics are unchanged in form and sharper in meaning: **a candidate must
address at least the range ssim2 addresses** (`max`/`p95`/`reach`/`DR`/`frac<0` ≥ ssim2's;
`min`/`p5`/negtail `min`/negtail `p1` ≤ ssim2's). Every report prints both columns —
**`bar (vs ssim2)`** and **`incumbent (shipped B)`** — so "worse than the mentor" and
"worse than what shipped" can never be confused.

**The mentor's own values** (full f64, straight out of `dial_addressability::to_json`; no
percentile math was re-implemented beside the owner):

| axis | ssim2 (THE BAR) | shipped B (retired bar, now `incumbent`) |
|---|--:|--:|
| A1 `max` ≥ | **98.376644** | 99.98330778475787 |
| A2 `min` ≤ | **−55.354544** | 3.12950123756248 |
| A3 `p95` ≥ | **95.45929934999998** | 99.72170874183841 |
| A4 `p5` ≤ | **10.26332105** | 13.645032446453126 |
| A5 `reach` ≥ | **153.731188** | 96.85380654719539 |
| A6 `dynamic_range` ≥ | **85.19597829999998** | 86.07667629538528 |
| A7 negtail `min` ≤ | **−770.619744** | 2.516685884084839 |
| A8 negtail `p1` ≤ | **−187.13142578999998** | 3.981383254902343 |
| A9 negtail `frac_below_zero` ≥ | **1.0** | 0.0 |
| — mono | 0.99235757295044 | 0.9791570171375636 |
| — tied | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| — identity dial | **100.0** (all 38 refs) | 96.24115978721524 |
| — cells above identity | **0** of 4,424 | 266 of 4,424 |

**A9's `1.0` is DEFINITIONAL, not a discovery** — the probe's population was selected by
"ssim2 < 0", so the reference metric is below zero on all 2,000 rows by construction. A9
therefore asks for perfect sign agreement with ssim2 on an all-negative population. That
is the strictest honest reading of "address at least the range ssim2 addresses", and it is
stated here so nobody mistakes it for an empirical bar.

## 14.3 The re-pin is NOT a relaxation — measured, 70 against 9

Re-grading all 17 candidates under **both** pin sets, same measurements, different bars

**70 cells flipped PASS → FAIL; 9 flipped FAIL → PASS.** The re-pin moved the difficulty
from the ceiling to the **floor**, which is correct: ssim2 reaches −55.35 on this grid
where shipped B stops at +3.13, and its negative-tail probe is 100 % below zero against
B's 0 %. Shipped B itself goes from **0** regression fails (it *was* the bar) to **6**.

**Round-trip control:** grading `peer_ssim2` against its own freshly-registered pins reads
**SHIPPABLE — regression PASS + contract PASS, 15 / 15**, with every bar tied bit-exactly.
That is the check that the pins were derived through the owner and not re-typed.

**One honest limit of the reach reading.** A1/A3 are `≥`, so a dial that *overshoots* the
truth passes — shipped B's `max` 99.98 clears A1 while sitting 1.6 above the reference
metric. G-ADDR is an **addressability** gate (how much range is reachable), not a
calibration gate, and over-reach is not an addressability failure. The alternative
**calibration-referenced** reading (`|dial end − truth end| ≤ δ`, or low-band / whole-grid
MAE against the reference metric) that §11 registered is still a separate, unimplemented
user option; this re-pin implements the reach reading only.

## 14.5 Is there a `B dial-era v2`? — **NO**, and for better reasons than before

**No candidate passes the re-pinned gate, so none is proposed for the board and no
discussion set is published.** But the *blocking axes changed completely*, and the new ones
are all real:

- Under the retired pins the leading arms failed **A4 / A6 / C2** — two of which §8 had
  already shown were bars the reference metric itself could not meet.
- Under the mentor's pins they fail **A2, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9 and C2** — the **floor and
  spread** axes, every one of them a genuine shortfall against a scorer that demonstrably
  reaches further.

The magnitude is not marginal. The best arm, `ss_unc_id100_lowband`, is **45.96 short on
A2**, **44.34 short on A5**, **758.94 short on A7**, **180.68 short on A8** and reaches
**6.6 %** of the negative tail where the mentor reaches **100 %**. Re-splining B cannot
close that: the whole B-lineage spread on A9 across every arm built in this lane is
0.0000 → 0.0660.

**C2 ⊻ C6 still blocks B, and it is still a WEIGHTS defect.** §10.3's proof is untouched by
the re-pin: 266 of 4,424 dial-grid cells (6.01 %) carry a raw prediction above the identity
vector's, so a monotone spline must either cap them (C2 fails, `tied` 0.0567 — measured on
every `id100` arm) or let them out-score a perfect copy (C5/C6 fail). No output spline
satisfies both. The fix is in the weights.

## 14.6 Then which dial should be the default? — a proposal for the user

Measured on the same instrument, same probes, same gate:

| | contract | regression | rank (CID22 / \|KonJND\| / AIC-3 / TID / KADID) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Profile A** `v47_strict_qat_native` | **PASS 6/6** | 0/9 | 0.86606 / 0.44313 / 0.77039 / 0.79264 / 0.79378 |
| **Profile D** `d_sdr_add156_dense_dial` (= ADD156) | 5/6 — **only C5** | **2/9** (A4, A6) | 0.86338 / **0.53319** / **0.77734** / **0.82348** / **0.80822** |
| shipped B | 2/6 | 3/9 | **0.88212** / 0.51938 / 0.76501 / 0.77852 / 0.80847 |

**Profile A is the only bake measured anywhere in this lane that passes the entire CONTRACT
tier** — identity 97.6893 in band, 0 cells above identity, and a negative tail that works
(55.75 % of the all-negative probe below zero, min −93.90). If a contract-passing dial
default has to be named **today**, it is A.

**But D is the better candidate, and its single contract failure is one dial edit away —
provably without B's either/or.** D fails only **C5**: its identity dial is 96.1157, which
is **1.384 below** the `[97.5, 100]` band. Two measured facts make that fixable in a way
B's is not:

1. **D's grid `max` is 96.049 — strictly BELOW its own identity of 96.1157.** Every one of
   the 4,424 cells already scores below a perfect copy (`above-identity = 0`). So the 266
   raw inversions that force B's C2 ⊻ C6 either/or **do not exist for D**, and anchoring
   D's identity at 100 cannot pile cells at the cap the way it does for every `id100` arm
   in §14.4 (`tied` 0.0567).
2. **D is already the closest thing to the mentor's floor that exists.** A9 `0.858` against
   the bar's `1.000` — a gap of 0.142, against 0.934 for the best B-lineage arm and 1.000
   for shipped B. On A8 it is 99.8 short where the best arm is 180.7 short.

D also beats A on **four of five** rank corpora (and is 0.0027 behind on CID22), and passes
**A4 and A6**, the only two regression axes any shipped bake passes.

**Proposal, for the user to decide:**

- **(i)** Name **Profile A** the contract-passing dial default *only if* one must be named
  before any new build. It is contract-clean today and nothing else is.
- **(ii)** Otherwise, build **`D-id100`** first — Profile D re-anchored with identity at
  100 — and re-gate it. Fact 1 above says the C2 cost that blocks the B lineage cannot
  arise. ~~**REGISTERED, NOT RUN:**~~ **RUN 2026-09-04 — see
  [`d_id100_2026-09-04.md`](d_id100_2026-09-04.md).** Fact 1 held: `tied` stays 0.0000 and
  `above-identity` stays 0. **`D-id100` reads CONTRACT 6/6 + REGRESSION 4/9** (A1 96.049 →
  99.380, A3 95.284 → 95.518, A4, A6) and **`D-id100-negrich` reads CONTRACT 6/6 +
  REGRESSION 7/9** — only A7 and A9 fail, both for measured structural reasons. Two of this
  bullet's premises were **overturned by measurement**: the pin is **not** deliverable by
  the fit (eight real re-fits folding identity into the Gram at 0.1 %–20 % of the data mass
  move the identity dial +0.0055 and cost −0.0125 CID22 — the identity Gram's `S`/`s`/`q`
  are all exactly zero, so it is nearly the bias offset that is a provable no-op), and it
  therefore **is** a re-spline: the winning arms carry weights **byte-identical** to shipped
  D (sha `330d8c09…` after stripping spline + repro), with zero pair-order flips on all 14
  corpora and `product_composite` byte-identical.
- **(iii)** shipped **B stays the rank leader on CID22** (0.88212) and is not displaced by
  either on that axis. The dial and the ranker are not the same decision.

## 14.7 What was added to the owners

`bake_verdict` gained three flags, all of which existed to make this measurable rather than
to make it pass:

- **`--negtail-peer-scores` / `--identity-peer-scores`** (`entry⇥pred`) — a reference
  metric has no bake, so before this its floor axes could not be measured at all, and a
  peer run silently reported *the peer's* grid reach beside *the bake's* tail depth under
  one headline, counting "cells above identity" across two different scorers. Peer mode is
  now **all-or-nothing per axis**: an unsupplied probe is NOT MEASURED, never filled in
  from `--bake`. Refused loudly.
- **`--gaddr-json <path>`** — the G-ADDR block alone at full f64, stamped with which scorer
  it describes. Peer-safe (unlike `--full-json`/`--fulleval`, which stay refused in peer
  mode). This is how a pin set is derived without duplicating percentile/tail math outside
  its owner, and it also closes §11's registered "the JSON is emitted; nothing reads it".
- **`--gaddr-reference <name>`** — grade against a named pin set. Default is
  `ACTIVE_REFERENCE` = `peer_ssim2`; `shipped_b` reproduces the retired grading through the
  same comparators, which is what makes §14.3 a measurement.

`scripts/dialgate_arms.sh` gained a **`score`** mode so re-grading an existing bake and
building a new arm end in the same `grade` function — a re-grade after a bar change cannot
accidentally be a different measurement from the build-time one.

**Tests** (`cargo test -p zensim-validate --lib dial_addressability`, 17 pass): both
directions of disagreement are covered by fixtures built from real measured values —
ssim2's own values fail the retired B bars on A1/A3/A6, B's own values fail the ssim2 bars
on A2/A5; A4 specifically is pinned to stop rewarding the low-band bias while still
accepting Profile D's real 9.52; the mentor's contract PASS is pinned; and the retired
shipped-B rows are asserted to survive. **Negative control:** deleting the `peer_ssim2`
rows from the registry fails **12 of the 17**.

## 14.8 Does the mentor itself pass the CONTRACT tier? — **YES, all six**

The question "what does *as good as the mentor* mean at the ends" has a measured answer.
`peer_ssim2`, graded by the same instrument on the same grid and probes:

| id | axis | bar | ssim2 measured | shipped B | verdict |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|:--:|
| C1 | monotonicity | ≥ 0.93 | **0.99235757295044** | 0.9791570171375636 | ✓ |
| C2 | flat/clamp dead-zone | ≤ 0.05 | **0.0** | 0.0 | ✓ |
| C3 | negative values WORK (`frac<0` on an all-negative probe) | > 0 | **1.0** | 0.0 | ✓ |
| C4 | deepest probe dial < 0 | < 0 | **−770.619744** | +2.516685884084839 | ✓ |
| C5 | `dial(ref==dist)` ∈ [97.5, 100] | 0 rows outside | **100.000000** (min = med = max, n=38) | 96.24115978721524 | ✓ |
| C6 | cells out-scoring a perfect copy | 0 | **0** of 4,424 | 266 of 4,424 | ✓ |

Three notes on how those were obtained, because the identity row is the one that could
have been assumed instead of measured:

- **C5 was MEASURED**, not taken from SSIMULACRA2's definition:
  `zenmetrics batch --metric ssim2` (the imazen CPU implementation) over the 38 dial-grid
  references paired **with themselves** reads exactly `100.000000` on all 38 — one distinct
  value, min = median = max. The grid truth is `ssim2_gpu`; identity is 100 by
  SSIMULACRA2's construction, which is why the cross-implementation question does not arise
  at this point.
- **C6 follows from two registry rows** with no extra measurement: the mentor's grid `max`
  (98.3766) is below its identity (100.0), so nothing can out-score a perfect copy. Pinned
  as a test.
- **C1 is the quiet one.** ssim2 is *more* monotone on this grid than the shipped dial
  (0.9924 vs 0.9792) with the same zero tied rate — so C1/C2 are not rows the mentor needed
  help with, and a candidate that beats ssim2 on monotonicity has to clear 0.9924, not the
  0.93 floor.

So the mentor is clean at both ends, and the four contract rows shipped B fails are
**not** rows that are unreachable in principle — the reference metric meets all of them,
and so does Profile A.

# 24h BALANCE CAMPAIGN — registered 2026-08-28T02:4xZ (user directive)

Directive verbatim: "work independently as a scientist for the next 24
hours, seeking truly balanced models that will work for hidden held out
sets, trying new hypothesis and thinking critically." Window: to
~2026-08-29T02:40Z. Overnight rule active (no questions 00:00-08:00 Denver;
decisions logged here, presented after).

## The critical framing (stated before any result)

1. **Selection-induced overfitting is now OUR biggest validity threat.**
   This session alone evaluated 9+ SDR seeds and 10+ HDR artifacts against
   the same axes (cid22, hfnlproxy, imazen26, nonphoto, bands, G-OUT).
   Every axis used for eligibility is EXPOSED: the winner's score on it is
   biased upward by selection. "Works on hidden held-out sets" therefore
   requires (a) a terminal panel the selection never touched, used ONCE,
   and (b) quantifying the selection bias itself.
2. **"Truly balanced" is operationalized as maximin**, not composite: the
   candidate's WORST normalized axis, not its weighted mean. Composites
   hide sacrificed axes (measured: the E.4 winner s4005P carries a
   CI-significant hfnl sacrifice its composite absorbs).

## Hypotheses (each falsifiable; frozen gates per-arm at execution)

- **H-DIAL-FLOOR**: the incumbent-family +5..+8 emission floor (LF-extreme
  collapse) is a PACK-ANCHOR property (anchor negative coverage), not a
  model property. Test: repack incumbent + s4006P + s4010P with a
  negrich-including anchor; if reach appears with rank axes unchanged
  (±0.002), the LF-extreme axis is a pack-recipe fix, not a selection axis.
- **H-ENS**: a 2-member ensemble of a cid22-best and an hfnl-best purity
  seed dominates both parents on maximin, and averaging halves the lone
  G-OUT B outlier. Test: averaged-prediction fulleval + G-OUT + paired CIs;
  ensemble class rules apply (M3a NOT COMPUTABLE, never penalized).
- **H-BAL (epoch-level balance)**: the cid22↔hfnl anti-separation across
  seeds arises because best_val epoch selection sees no HF signal; adding
  an HF val leg to the val geomean lets a SINGLE run select a balanced
  checkpoint. Test: one arm, purity recipe + tbig_hf val-weighted (0:1.0),
  vs SPH1 (train-weighted) — mechanism comparison.
- **H-MAXIMIN**: maximin-selected candidates generalize better to the
  hidden panel than composite-selected ones. Test at terminal read only.
- **H-KON**: the konjnd 3× peer outlier rate traces to the konjnd_bpg
  train leg's val-only twin (train_eq_val mismatch on JND content).
  Diagnose from per-pair structure before any arm.
- **H-HID (the hidden panel, built now, read ONCE at campaign end)**:
  KADIS-700k GPU-canonical cells NEVER in any training slice (stratified
  ~20k, disjoint source_ids from the 50k train slice), with its 7
  independent metric targets; plus the never-selected axes (sdr25, aic3,
  aic4, csiq, tid) as semi-hidden secondaries; plus external reads for HDR
  finalists. No candidate decision may touch H-HID before the terminal
  read; this registration is the enforcement.

## Standing constraints
NO ship-default flips; freezes remain proposals to the user; every arm
registered in its owning wave md before fit; every result committed; docs +
memory updated in-pass. SPH1 + GH2 (already registered, user-called)
continue and fold into the balance picture.

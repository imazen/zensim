# zensim

A perceptual image quality score for codec quality targeting: users choose one
score, and encoders choose the settings to reach it.

Built on the same psychovisual foundations as SSIMULACRA2 and butteraugli — multi-scale SSIM, edge artifacts, detail loss, and high-frequency features in XYB color space — but with trained weights, fused SIMD kernels, and multi-threaded computation.

**Current checkout (2026-09-07):** the user-facing control is one target score.
`codec_target()` returns B; D is an explicit fast profile. Negative scores are
valid. The benchmark tables below are historical measurements, not a fresh
qualification of today's profiles. See the [current integration guide](https://github.com/imazen/zensim/blob/main/docs/CODEC_TARGET_METRIC.md)
for bake identities, actual consumer behavior and the remaining dial requirements.

**Interactive chart exploration**: <https://imazen.github.io/zensim/> — scatter zensim / fast-ssim2 / butteraugli against human MOS across CID22 / KADID / TID / AIC corpora, filter by codec + version, with per-band SROCC tables and step-5 (20-bin) breakdowns.


## Correlation with human perception

Quality targeting requires both perceptual agreement and a useful score range.
The tables below preserve the older v0.3/A evaluation; B's dated methodology is
in its [July record](https://github.com/imazen/zensim/blob/main/benchmarks/profile_b_methodology_2026-07-12.md).
They do not qualify the current profiles against September's stricter dial
requirements. CID22 has also been consulted repeatedly during model selection;
it is not an untouched final test. Current split policy and exceptions are in
[DATA_SPLITS](https://github.com/imazen/zensim/blob/main/docs/DATA_SPLITS.md).


## Quick start

```toml
[dependencies]
zensim = "0.3"
```

```rust
use zensim::{Zensim, ZensimProfile, RgbSlice};

// Use the common codec-target profile (currently B for SDR):
let z = Zensim::new(ZensimProfile::codec_target());
// Reproducible experiments also pin the dependency, bake and extractor
// revision; selecting a profile name alone does not freeze its bytes.
// Use the absolute-luminance API and BHdr route for HDR content.
// `src_pixels` / `dst_pixels` are `&[[u8; 3]]` — interleaved, sRGB-encoded
// (gamma, NOT linear) 8-bit RGB. `width`/`height` are `usize`. See "Input
// format" below: getting sRGB-vs-linear wrong silently corrupts every score.
let source = RgbSlice::new(&src_pixels, width, height);
let distorted = RgbSlice::new(&dst_pixels, width, height);
// `compute` returns `Result<ZensimResult, zensim::ZensimError>` — the `?`
// propagates a dimension-mismatch / too-small / too-large error.
let result = z.compute(&source, &distorted)?;
println!("score: {:.2}", result.score()); // 100 = identical, higher = better
```

Also accepts `RgbaSlice` (composited over a noise background), `imgref::ImgRef` (with stride), `ZenpixelsSource` (with `zenpixels` feature), and `StridedBytes` for BGRA, 16-bit, linear float, and wide gamut (Display P3, BT.2020) inputs. See [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/zensim) for the full `ImageSource` trait.

### Input format (read this — wrong input silently corrupts the score)

The score is only meaningful if the pixels you pass match the contract zensim assumes. There is **no format auto-detection** for the `RgbSlice` fast path: if you hand it linear bytes where it expects sRGB, or planar bytes where it expects interleaved, it computes a perfectly valid-looking but wrong score — no error is raised. The contract:

- **Color encoding: sRGB-encoded (gamma), NOT linear.** `RgbSlice` / `RgbaSlice` / the `Srgb8*` and `Srgb16Rgba` `StridedBytes` formats all expect **display-encoded sRGB** values — the bytes a PNG/JPEG decoder gives you. zensim linearizes internally before the XYB conversion. If your data is already linear light, do **not** feed it as sRGB; use `StridedBytes` with `PixelFormat::LinearF32Rgba` (linear 32-bit float RGBA) instead. (Display P3 reuses the sRGB transfer function, so `Srgb8*` formats linearize it correctly; SDR BT.2020 technically wants BT.1886 — for exact results linearize externally and use `LinearF32Rgba`. Set primaries via `StridedBytes::with_color_primaries`.)
- **Channel order: interleaved, not planar.** `RgbSlice` takes `&[[u8; 3]]` laid out `R,G,B, R,G,B, …` (one `[u8; 3]` per pixel), `RgbaSlice` takes `&[[u8; 4]]` as `R,G,B,A, …`. **Planar** input (all R, then all G, then all B) is **not** accepted by these types — you must interleave it first, or describe it some other way. The `[[u8; 3]]` / `[[u8; 4]]` element type also pins it to exactly 3 / 4 bytes per pixel, **tightly packed** (no per-row padding) — for row padding use `StridedBytes` (below).
- **Dimensions: `width` and `height` are `usize`** (not `u32`). Both `RgbSlice::new(data, width, height)` and the underlying `ImageSource::{width,height}` use `usize`.
- **Both images must have identical dimensions**, and each must be non-zero. `compute` returns `ZensimError::DimensionMismatch` if they differ, `ZensimError::ImageTooSmall` if either dimension is `0`. (Since 0.3.0, sub-64px images down to 1×1 are reflect-padded internally and score normally — only empty inputs are rejected.)

The infallible constructors (`RgbSlice::new`, `RgbaSlice::new`, `StridedBytes::new`) **panic** if `data.len()` is too short for `width × height` (or the stride is invalid). For untrusted sizes use the `try_*` variants — `RgbSlice::try_new(data, width, height) -> Result<RgbSlice, ZensimError>` etc. — which return `ZensimError::InvalidDataLength` / `ZensimError::InvalidStride` / `ZensimError::ImageTooLarge` instead of panicking.

### Return type and errors

```rust
pub fn compute(
    &self,
    source: &impl ImageSource,
    distorted: &impl ImageSource,
) -> Result<ZensimResult, zensim::ZensimError>
```

`ZensimError` is a `#[non_exhaustive]` enum (so match it with a `_` arm) — the variants `compute` can return are `DimensionMismatch`, `ImageTooSmall`, and `ImageTooLarge` (dimensions exceed the configured `max_pixels` cap — **120 MP by default** since #49; tighten it with `Zensim::with_max_pixels`, or pass `with_max_pixels(usize::MAX)` to opt out for trusted input — or `width × height` overflows `usize` on 32-bit / wasm32). HDR-flagged sources (`ImageSource::is_hdr` returns `true`) are refused with `HdrInputRequiresPuPath` — score HDR via the PU21 front-end (`Zensim::compute_pu_linear`, fed absolute-luminance linear RGB in cd/m²) instead. On success, `ZensimResult::score()` is the `0..100` similarity; `raw_distance()`, `approx_ssim2()`, `approx_dssim()`, and `approx_butteraugli()` are also available (see "What the score means").

### Strided / padded rows

When rows are not tightly packed (SIMD-aligned padding, a sub-region crop of a larger buffer, decoder output with row guards), use `StridedBytes`, where `stride` is the **byte** distance between the start of consecutive rows:

```rust
use zensim::{StridedBytes, PixelFormat};

// e.g. 8-bit RGB where each row is padded to `row_stride` bytes (≥ width*3):
let src = StridedBytes::new(&bytes, width, height, row_stride, PixelFormat::Srgb8Rgb);
// `try_new(..) -> Result<_, ZensimError>` returns InvalidStride / InvalidDataLength
// instead of panicking. `with_alpha_mode(.., AlphaMode)` / `with_color_primaries(..)`
// set alpha handling and gamut; default alpha mode is `AlphaMode::Unknown`.
let result = z.compute(&src, &dst)?;
```

With the `imgref` feature (on by default), `imgref::ImgRef<'_, rgb::Rgb<u8>>` and `ImgRef<'_, rgb::Rgba<u8>>` implement `ImageSource` directly and honor their pixel stride — pass an `ImgRef` straight to `compute`. (The element type must be `rgb::Rgb<u8>` / `rgb::Rgba<u8>`; the `ImgRef` stride is in pixels.)

### Cancellation

A single `compute` / `compute_with_ref` call is **not** interruptible mid-computation — the `zensim` metric library exposes no `Stop`-token parameter, and a single comparison is typically tens of milliseconds (~22 ms at 1080p). Cancellation is at the granularity of *your* loop: when comparing one reference against many distorted variants (see "Batch comparison"), check your own cancellation flag between `compute_with_ref` calls. The `enough` cooperative-cancellation crate is used by the `zensim-target` codec-targeting CLI (to bound its binary-search loop) and `zensim-regress`, not by the core metric API.

### zenpixels integration

With the `zenpixels` feature, pass any `PixelSlice` or `PixelBuffer` directly:

```toml
[dependencies]
zensim = { version = "0.3", features = ["zenpixels"] }
```

```rust
use zensim::{Zensim, ZensimProfile, ZenpixelsSource};

let source = ZenpixelsSource::try_from_slice(&pixel_slice)?;
let distorted = ZenpixelsSource::try_from_slice(&other_slice)?;
let result = Zensim::new(ZensimProfile::codec_target()).compute(&source, &distorted)?;
```

Format mapping is automatic: RGBX/BGRX becomes opaque, premultiplied alpha is un-premultiplied, color primaries are forwarded. HDR (PQ, HLG) and grayscale are rejected with `UnsupportedFormat`.

## Target-score CLI (`zensim-target`)

The [`zensim-target`](zensim-target/README.md) standalone workspace is the
runtime side of the "user-facing quality dial" goal. Given an input
image and a target zensim score, it picks the codec quality knob via
binary search:

```bash
cargo run --release --manifest-path zensim-target/Cargo.toml --bin zensim-target -- \
    input.png --target 70 --codec zenjpeg --profile codec-target --output out.jpg
```

The explicit profile matters: the library defaults to B, while the CLI still
defaults to historical `tuner-v4`. JPEG, WebP, AVIF and PNG are enabled by
default; JXL encode/decode requires `--features zenjxl` before `--`.
The historical May 18 demo matrix at
[`benchmarks/zensim_target_demo_2026-05-18.md`](https://github.com/imazen/zensim/blob/main/benchmarks/zensim_target_demo_2026-05-18.md):
reported 33 / 36 cells within ±1.5 score units, median 5 iterations. Those
are dated demo results; inspect today's returned `converged` and achieved
score rather than assuming the target was reached.

`zensim-target` is **AGPL-3.0-only** because it links the AGPL zen
codec crates; the core `zensim` library stays MIT/Apache.

## What the score means

100 = identical; higher = more similar. Negative values represent severe
degradation and must remain visible. Byte-identical inputs short-circuit to
100; that does not prove a model's near-identity behavior. A monotone output
spline preserves raw ordering and cannot repair a raw codec-quality inversion.
The historical JND-at-60 convention below is not a universal perceptual
guarantee for current profiles; see the [score contract](docs/CODEC_TARGET_METRIC.md).

Each `ZensimResult` also provides approximate translations to other metrics:

| Method | What it returns |
|--------|-----------------|
| `score()` | Zensim similarity; higher is better, negative values are valid |
| `raw_distance()` | Feature distance before mapping (lower = better) |
| `approx_ssim2()` | SSIMULACRA2 estimate (MAE 4.4 pts, Pearson r = 0.974) |
| `approx_dssim()` | DSSIM estimate (MAE 0.00129, Pearson r = 0.952) |
| `approx_butteraugli()` | Butteraugli estimate (MAE 1.65, Pearson r = 0.713) |

The `mapping` module has bidirectional interpolation tables — including JPEG quality. These are median values from 344k synthetic pairs across 6 codecs (source: `zensim/src/mapping.rs`):

| Zensim | ≈ SSIM2 | ≈ DSSIM | ≈ JPEG quality |
|-------:|--------:|--------:|:---------------|
| 98 | 96.50 | 0.000017 | ~q95 |
| 90 | 89.41 | 0.000278 | ~q60 |
| 80 | 80.51 | 0.001119 | ~q30 |
| 70 | 71.40 | 0.002356 | — |

JPEG quality mapping accuracy is ±7 quality units MAE — individual images vary widely.

## Regression testing

[**zensim-regress**](https://github.com/imazen/zensim/blob/main/zensim-regress/README.md) tracks pixel output across platforms and dependency updates. Hash-based checksums for fast exact matches; perceptual comparison with forensic evidence when hashes diverge. Amplified diff images, error classification, architecture-specific tolerances, CI manifests, and HTML reports.

```rust
use zensim_regress::checksums::{ChecksumManager, CheckResult};

let mgr = ChecksumManager::new("tests/checksums".as_ref());
let result = mgr.check_pixels("resize", "bicubic", "200x200",
    &pixels, width, height, None).unwrap();
assert!(result.passed(), "{result}");
```

Run with `UPDATE_CHECKSUMS=1` to create baselines. See the [zensim-regress guide](https://github.com/imazen/zensim/blob/main/zensim-regress/README.md) for the full workflow.

## Batch comparison

Compare one reference against many distorted variants. Precomputing the reference skips redundant XYB conversion and pyramid construction — saves ~25% per comparison at 4K.

```rust
let precomputed = z.precompute_reference(&source)?;
for dst_pixels in &distorted_images {
    let dst = RgbSlice::new(dst_pixels, width, height);
    let result = z.compute_with_ref(&precomputed, &dst)?;
}
```

## How it works

The extractor computes the features declared by the selected bake, scored by
trained weights. The original 228-feature vocabulary included:

- **SSIM** (mean, L2, L4 pooling) — structural similarity in XYB, using ssimulacra2's modified formula (no luminance denominator)
- **Edge artifacts** (mean, L2, L4) — ringing, banding, blockiness
- **Detail loss** (mean, L2, L4) — blur, smoothing, texture destruction
- **MSE** in XYB color space
- **High-frequency features** — energy loss, magnitude loss, energy gain
- **Peak features** — per-feature max and L8-pooled (near-worst-case)

Computed in XYB (cube-root LMS) with O(1)-per-pixel box blur and fused AVX2/AVX-512 SIMD kernels via [archmage](https://crates.io/crates/archmage). Safe scalar fallback on all platforms.

## Profiles

Each `ZensimProfile` bundles weights and score-mapping parameters. A profile
name is not a frozen model: pin the bake and extraction revision when
reproducing scores. Current checkout mapping, checked September 7:

| Profile | Role and declared features | Bake size |
|---------|----------------------------|----------:|
| `B` (**default** — `codec_target()`) | SDR linear ensemble + dial spline; 95 IDs | 2,012 B |
| `BHdr` | HDR linear ensemble on absolute-luminance features; 133 IDs | 5,331 B |
| `D` | Fast SDR linear profile + id100/negative-tail spline; 28 IDs | 1,420 B |
| `C` / `CHdr` | SDR/HDR candidates; 944-wide bakes, activity-toggle discrepancy remains | 149,343 / 180,195 B |
| `A` (**deprecated**) | Prior MLP profile; 285 IDs | 26,456 B |
| `PreviewV0_1` / `PreviewV0_2` | Original 228-weight linear profiles, retained for compatibility | In-source arrays |

Exact filenames, hashes, serving limitations and evaluation records are in the
[integration guide](https://github.com/imazen/zensim/blob/main/docs/CODEC_TARGET_METRIC.md).

`ZensimProfile::codec_target()` and `latest_preview()` both return `B` — the canonical production codec-target the zen codecs dial against (the deprecated `latest()` also returns `B`). `A` (the prior default, the v47 MLP) is now `#[deprecated]` and lives behind the default-on `deprecated-profiles` feature — build with `--no-default-features` to drop it. To load your own bake, construct `ZensimProfile::Custom { params, name }` via [`ProfileParams::builder()`](https://docs.rs/zensim/latest/zensim/profile/struct.ProfileParams.html). Results are deterministic for the same input on the same architecture; cross-architecture scores (AVX2 vs scalar vs AVX-512) may differ by small ULP.

**`D` dial-era v2 (2026-09-05).** `D`'s bake changed from `d_sdr_add156_dense_dial_2026-08-31.bin` to `d_sdr_add156_id100_negrich_dial_2026-09-05.bin`. **The forward pass is byte-identical** (both strip to the same weight bytes), so rank and speed do not move — pooled SROCC is bit-identical on 11 of 14 canonical corpora and within a monotone remap's tie residue on the other three (`kadid` −1.3e-7, `live` +5.8e-7, `tid` +7.9e-6); CID22 is 0.863380 before and after. What changes is the **dial**: a perfect copy now reads **100.000** instead of 96.116, the dial-grid top moves 96.05 → 99.38 (p95 95.28 → 95.52) and the bottom −12.20 → −57.17 (p5 9.52 → 8.83), reach 108.25 → 156.55, and the deepest negative-tail probe row −100.0 → −213.1 — negative scores work further out, which is the product contract, not a regression. No grid cell out-scores identity, before or after (0 of 4,424). **Stored `zensim-d` dial values predate this and must be re-read, not rescaled** — the remap is a PCHIP spline, not an affine. Details + gates: [`benchmarks/d_ship_flip_2026-09-05.md`](benchmarks/d_ship_flip_2026-09-05.md).

`ZensimProfile::PreviewV0_1` / `PreviewV0_2` (the linear profiles that shipped in 0.2.7) are RETAINED as first-class, non-deprecated, selectable variants — the 0.3.0 line reverted their removal (commit `493c91cd`) to preserve semver compatibility with 0.2.7; see the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` **Restored** entry. `B` is the current deterministic-linear default for SDR content.

The historical `PreviewV0_4` / `PreviewV0_5*` SOTA-trail variants, `A_Phone`, and `LinearBounded` live in the **`zensim-experimental`** crate (not published), each rebuilt through the `Custom` extension point — e.g. `Zensim::new(zensim_experimental::preview_v0_5_tuner_v4())`. zenpredict (the MLP runtime) is MIT/Apache-2.0 — no AGPL transitive obligation on default builds.

## A. Evaluation methodology — the 2026 consensus

If §1–§11 are about *what to put inside* zensim, this section is about *how to judge whether the change was an improvement.* It is the only section in this doc that overlaps directly with zensim's CLAUDE.md ("Statistical rigor — mandatory full-stat reporting", "Per-band reporting rule", "SROCC-only verdicts BANNED"). Re-stated here so the doc is self-contained.

### A.1 The reference paper

**Mohammadi, Jenadeleh, Sneyers, Saupe, Ascenso — *Evaluation of Objective IQA Metrics for High-Fidelity Image Compression*** (arXiv 2509.13150, IEEE Access 2025). Two arguments the field accepted quickly: **SROCC alone is the single most misleading practice in IQA evaluation**, and **between-metric ranking requires a paired statistical test** because metrics are correlated through the shared MOS.

Combined with the JPEG **AIC-3 protocol** (Testolina/Saupe 2023, HDR extension Jenadeleh/Mohammadi 2025), these two papers now define how IQA studies are reported.

### A.2 The mandatory statistical panel (per-metric, aggregate + 10-band)

| Stat | What it answers | When it disagrees with SROCC |
|---|---|---|
| **SROCC** (Spearman) | Rank agreement | Default; one of six, not the verdict. |
| **PLCC** (Pearson, on calibrated outputs) | Dial honesty — is a 1-pt metric change a 1-pt MOS change? | Captures calibration error SROCC ignores. |
| **KROCC** (Kendall τ) | Rank agreement, more stable at small n | Sometimes wins over SROCC when n < 100. |
| **OR** (Outlier Ratio) | Fraction of predictions outside ±2σ of MOS | Reveals pathologies SROCC averages over. |
| **PWRC** (Pearson-Weighted Rank Correlation) | Rank correlation weighted by pair importance | Down-weights ties / duplicates SROCC counts as wins. |
| **Z-RMSE** (per-sample σ-normalized RMSE) | Absolute calibration error, weighted by per-stimulus subjective spread | The single most decisive stat when bootstrap σ exists. Example: SSIMULACRA2 SROCC 0.905 vs CVVDP 0.960 *looks* like a 5 % gap; **Z-RMSE 47.6 vs 9.5 reveals the actual scale gap is 5×**. |

`Z-RMSE = √((1/n) · Σ ((Ŝᵢ − μᵢ) / σᵢ)²)` where `μᵢ, σᵢ` are bootstrap MOS stats per stimulus. Penalizes errors *less* where humans disagreed, *more* where the JND is sharp.

### A.3 Paired-significance tests (between two metrics on shared MOS)

| Test | Use | Report |
|---|---|---|
| **Meng-Rosenthal-Rubin (MRR)** | Paired SROCC delta between metrics A and B sharing the same MOS targets | z-statistic + p-value (never just "p < 0.05") |
| **Wilcoxon signed-rank on residuals** | Non-parametric companion to MRR | p-value + effect size `r = Z/√N` |
| **Bootstrap 95 % CI**, 1000 resamples, percentile method | Required for every per-metric correlation AND every between-metric delta | CI half-width — AIC-3 standard is ≤ 0.27 JND at 1 JND nominal |

A bare claim "metric A beats B on SROCC" is no longer publishable; you need the MRR delta with effect size and the CI overlap status.

### A.4 Subjective-data collection — JPEG AIC-3 protocol (when generating new MOS)

If you're collecting fresh subjective data in the q ≥ 80 / NVL range, the only protocol that survives peer review:

1. **Plain triplet comparisons (PTC)** + **boosted triplet comparisons (BTC)** with three boosters: 10 Hz flicker, 2× spatial zoom, 2× artifact amplification.
2. **Thurstone Case V** maximum-likelihood reconstruction → continuous JND scale, with `d · Φ⁻¹(0.75) = 1` → `d ≈ 0.6745`. 1 JND = 75 % detection probability.
3. **Otsu batch-screening thresholds** ≈ 0.66 (PTC), 0.70 (BTC) on per-subject accuracy + consistency.
4. **Bootstrap σ per stimulus**, kept alongside the MOS so consumers can compute Z-RMSE.

Below the AIC-3 range, DSCQS / ACR / pair-comparison still apply, but JOD-aligned aggregation via Thurstone is the default — single-lab MOS averaging is no longer trusted across studies.

### A.5 Validation-corpus hierarchy

| Tier | Corpus | Role | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gold | **CID22** (Sneyers/Ben Baruch/Vaxman 2023, JPEG WG1 wg1m99012) | Compression-specific MOS, 49 refs held out | Only large MOS dataset that exercises *codec* artifacts |
| Gold | **AIC-3** (Testolina 2023) + **AIC-HDR2025** + **AIC-JPEG-AI SDR 2025** | High-fidelity JND scale, codec-rich (incl. learning codecs) | Fine-grained JND-calibrated; designed for q ≥ 80 |
| Anchor | **KonJND-1k** (1008 images, PJND thresholds) + **KonJND++** (300 sources × 129 click maps) | Imperceptibility threshold calibration; spatial JND map | Different psychometric scale than MOS — orthogonal check |
| Anchor | **UPIQ** (Mikhailiuk et al. 2022, ~4000 images) | Unified SDR + HDR JOD scale | Recalibration anchor for HDR-VDP-3 and CVVDP |
| Integrity | **KADID-10k**, **TID2013**, **CSIQ**, **LIVE** | Distortion-diversity check | Catch metric collapses on non-compression artifacts; **not for ranking** — distortions are mostly synthetic blur/noise/color |

**The 2026 anti-pattern:** ranking metrics on KADID/TID alone, or on aggregate `(KADID + TID + CID22)/3` SROCC. Mohammadi 2025 is explicit — non-compression synthetic distortions can flip metric rankings versus codec output, so they're integrity guards, not gold standards.

### A.6 Reporting protocol — three rules

1. **10 bands, not 4.** Width-10 bins B0..B9 over the MCOS / SSIMULACRA scale. The legacy 4-band CID22 Table 5 cuts are reported alongside *only* for paper-comparison. Aggregate stats hide band-specific failures; product decisions live in B0..B5.
2. **Full panel per band** (all 6 stats from §A.2), not just SROCC. A metric can win SROCC on a band while losing Z-RMSE (miscalibration) or losing PWRC (wins on duplicates that don't matter). The joint pattern is the signal.
3. **MRR-paired delta with effect size** when claiming "A is better than B." Bare PLCC/SROCC deltas are not publishable.

For per-band tables, flag bands with `n < 30` as "noisy estimate" — the CI half-width exceeds 0.3 SROCC at that n and ranking between bakes is statistically indistinguishable.

### A.7 What's actually the best metric (2026 benchmarks)

From the two flagship 2025 datasets — **AIC-HDR2025** (34,560 ratings × 151 subjects × 4 codecs) and **AIC-JPEG-AI SDR 2025** (96,200 ratings × 459 subjects × 6 codecs including JPEG AI):

| Rank | Metric | PLCC range | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1st overall** | **ColorVideoVDP (cvvdp)** | **0.936 – 0.968** | Default best general-purpose perceptual metric. Wins PLCC, SROCC, and Z-RMSE on every codec including JPEG AI. Free, MIT, GPU (`gfxdisp/ColorVideoVDP`). |
| 2nd | **HDR-VDP-3** | 0.919 – 0.963 | Statistically tied with cvvdp on HDR. Use when inputs are absolute-luminance / display-referred. |
| 3rd (per-source) | **SSIMULACRA2** | 0.906 overall, **0.968 per-source** | Strongest *per-source* PLCC of any non-VDP metric. Designed for codec artifacts; slightly under-sensitive to chroma-only distortions. |
| 4th (learning codecs) | **VMAF-neg** | 0.909 – 0.958 | The best metric for *learning-based* codec outputs (JPEG AI, learned compression). Worse than SSIMULACRA2 on traditional codecs. |
| 5th | **Butteraugli p-norm** | 0.882 – 0.910 | Stable across codecs; parent of SSIMULACRA2. |
| Below the floor | PSNR-HVS, MS-SSIM, IW-SSIM, PSNR | 0.6 – 0.85 | Integrity baselines only — not ranking targets. |

**The 2026 best-practice metric *stack* is three metrics, not one:**
- **cvvdp** + **SSIMULACRA2** + **VMAF-neg**
- Reported with the full Mohammadi panel per band per corpus
- Paired MRR tests + 95 % bootstrap CIs when claiming a winner

That stack is the dial against which zensim is being measured.

### A.8 Two surfacing notes for zensim specifically

- The CLAUDE.md per-band-panel requirement extending `dataset_metric_baseline` to emit the full 6-stat panel per band (not just SROCC + CI) is the one piece of tooling that gates every evaluation in this doc. Until it lands, every "champion" claim is provisional — the CLAUDE.md says exactly this.
- The single highest-yield change in §8 (EX-1, Thurstone loss replacement) only pays off if A.6 reporting is honest. A Thurstone-trained bake will *lose* SROCC on whatever metric the prior bake was supervised against (because it's no longer ssim2-shaped), but should *win* PWRC and Z-RMSE on independent corpora. Without the full panel, the change looks like a regression.

### A.9 The decisive comparison formula and rule

There is no single closed-form scalar that decides "metric A beats metric B for compression in band X" — Mohammadi 2025's argument is precisely that you need multi-stat agreement. But there *is* a closest-thing-to-a-formula, and a decisive *rule* on top of it.

#### The formula: MRR z-test on SROCC (and on Z-RMSE)

**Meng-Rosenthal-Rubin (MRR) paired-correlation test**, computed per band:

```
z_A  = atanh(SROCC_A)                # Fisher z-transform of A's SROCC vs MOS
z_B  = atanh(SROCC_B)
r_AB = SROCC(A_scores, B_scores)     # how A and B agree with each other
r_AZ = SROCC_A                       # A vs MOS
r_BZ = SROCC_B                       # B vs MOS

f    = (1 − r_AB) / (2 · (1 − r_AZ²) · (1 − r_BZ²))

h_SROCC = (z_A − z_B) · √(n_band − 3) / √(2 · (1 − r_AB) · f)
```

`h_SROCC` is distributed as a standard normal under the null hypothesis that A and B are equally correlated with MOS. **|h| > 1.96 ⇒ p < 0.05** that A ≠ B in this band; sign of h tells you which is better.

**For image compression specifically, also compute MRR on Z-RMSE.** Replace `SROCC_*` with `1 − Z-RMSE_* / σ_max` inside the same MRR machinery. Z-RMSE is the load-bearing stat for compression because it weights errors by the per-stimulus MOS uncertainty captured by AIC-3's bootstrap σ. Mohammadi's example: SROCC says SSIMULACRA2 and cvvdp differ by 5 %; Z-RMSE says they differ by 5×. MRR-on-Z-RMSE catches that.

#### The decisive rule

A single MRR `h > 1.96` is necessary, not sufficient — a metric can win SROCC while losing calibration. The field-converged rule:

```
DECISIVE_FOR_BAND(A beats B) ⟺
    n_band ≥ 30                                            # not "noisy"
  ∧ |h_SROCC(A, B; band)| > 1.96       ∧ h_SROCC > 0       # SROCC significant in A's favor
  ∧ |h_Z-RMSE(A, B; band)| > 1.96      ∧ h_Z-RMSE > 0      # calibration significant in A's favor
  ∧ PWRC_A > PWRC_B                                        # weighted rank agrees
  ∧ 95 % bootstrap CIs of (A − B) on ≥ 4 of {SROCC, PLCC,
      KROCC, OR, PWRC, Z-RMSE} exclude zero in A's favor   # multi-stat agreement
```

**A decisively beats B in a band when** the MRR test is significant on *both* SROCC and Z-RMSE in A's favor, **and** at least four of the six panel stats agree, **and** PWRC moves in the right direction, **and** the band has at least 30 samples. Anything weaker — single-stat win, n < 30, bootstrap CIs that overlap — is "promising, not decisive."

#### The "least-bad scalar" if forced to compress to one number

```
DecisiveScore(A vs B; band) =
      h_SROCC
    · sign(Z-RMSE_B − Z-RMSE_A)          # +1 if A better calibrated
    · sign(PWRC_A − PWRC_B)              # +1 if A weighted-rank wins
    · agreement_fraction ∈ [0, 1]        # fraction of 6 panel stats favoring A
    · √min(n_band, 100) / 10             # n-confidence damping
```

Practical decisive cutoff: `|DecisiveScore| > 1.96 · 4 · 1 ≈ 7.84` (MRR significance × full agreement × full n).

**Do not use the scalar without the rule above as a sanity check.** The reason the field uses a rule and not a scalar is that the joint pattern matters — a high MRR z that comes with bad Z-RMSE is a calibration disaster pretending to be a win, and a scalar collapses that information.

#### Workflow for any V_X comparison

When deciding whether bake A beats bake B in band B3:

1. Compute the full Mohammadi panel (SROCC, PLCC, KROCC, OR, PWRC, Z-RMSE) for both bakes against the same held-out per-band slice (CID22 + AIC-3 + KonJND-1k).
2. Compute `r_AB` (the SROCC between the two bakes' outputs themselves) — needed for MRR.
3. Compute `h_SROCC` and `h_Z-RMSE`.
4. 1000-resample bootstrap CIs of every (A − B) panel-stat delta.
5. Apply the rule above. Record DecisiveScore + the rule's truth value side by side in the methodology doc.

If `h_SROCC > 1.96` but `Z-RMSE_A > Z-RMSE_B`, A is shaped wrong even though it ranks images correctly — that's the V_20 input-shaping failure mode (per CLAUDE.md "V_20 input-shaping is a B3 specialist, not an aggregate win"). A wins the rank test, A loses the calibration test, A is not decisively better — flag for user judgement.

#### Reference implementation sketch (Rust)

```rust
fn mrr_h(
    srocc_a: f64,   // metric A vs MOS
    srocc_b: f64,   // metric B vs MOS
    r_ab:    f64,   // SROCC between A and B themselves
    n_band:  usize,
) -> f64 {
    let za = srocc_a.atanh();
    let zb = srocc_b.atanh();
    let denom = (1.0 - srocc_a.powi(2)) * (1.0 - srocc_b.powi(2));
    let f = (1.0 - r_ab) / (2.0 * denom);
    let scale = ((n_band - 3) as f64).sqrt() / (2.0 * (1.0 - r_ab) * f).sqrt();
    (za - zb) * scale
}

fn decisive(a: &PanelStats, b: &PanelStats, n_band: usize) -> Decision {
    if n_band < 30 { return Decision::Noisy; }
    let h_s = mrr_h(a.srocc, b.srocc, a.r_ab, n_band);
    let h_z = mrr_h(1.0 - a.z_rmse / a.z_rmse_max,
                    1.0 - b.z_rmse / b.z_rmse_max,
                    a.r_ab, n_band);
    let pwrc_ok = a.pwrc > b.pwrc;
    let panel_agreement = a.panel_wins_vs(b);  // count of 6 where CI excludes 0
    if h_s > 1.96 && h_z > 1.96 && pwrc_ok && panel_agreement >= 4 {
        Decision::ADecisivelyBeatsB
    } else if h_s < -1.96 && h_z < -1.96 && !pwrc_ok && panel_agreement <= 2 {
        Decision::BDecisivelyBeatsA
    } else {
        Decision::PromisingNotDecisive
    }
}
```

This is the function that should live in `zensim-validate` once `dataset_metric_baseline` emits the full panel per band.

## 1. Color front-ends — XYB, LMS-biased-log, PU encoding

### Findings

- **XYB** (JPEG XL): cube-root transfer applied to an LMS-like matrix; designed so that perceptually similar colors are Euclidean-close. Used for both encoding and as the front-end of the *encoder's* internal Butteraugli loss.
- **Butteraugli's own front-end is LMS with a *biased-log* transfer**, *not* XYB — "similar but not identical" per Alakuijala et al. (Guetzli paper). The biased-log keeps low-luma sensitivity high while compressing high-luma gracefully.
- **PU encoding** (Aydın 2008; HDR-VDP-2/3): maps absolute cd/m² to a perceptually-uniform value via a contrast-sensitivity-derived curve. Without PU, *every* SDR-trained metric saturates or inverts on HDR (HDR-VDP-2 paper: PSNR on raw luminance "essentially uncorrelated"). PU encoding is valid 0.1–80 cd/m² as constrained to mimic sRGB inverse-gamma; extends linearly through HDR range.
- **Oklab** is mentioned in several modern IQA-loss formulations as a fast XYB substitute, especially for *chroma* terms; not psycho-tuned but cheap and perceptually-uniform-enough for color-difference work.

### What zensim could do

1. **Stage a non-linear color front-end before the 228-feature extractor.** Two options, both ~2 days of work:
   - *XYB* (libjxl-style): one 3×3 matrix mul + cube-root per pixel. Matches the codec-side color we already accept (JXL VarDCT operates in XYB).
   - *LMS biased-log* (Butteraugli-style): same 3×3 + biased-log `f(x) = log(x + b)`, with `b ≈ 0.01`. Used by every Butteraugli/SSIMULACRA2/Guetzli/Jpegli system in our corpus.
2. **Add a PU-encoded path** behind a `--hdr` feature flag once the SDR pipeline is solid. The two paths share everything but the front-end. PU source: `https://goo.gl/rpfkB9` (linked in Aydın 2008 paper).
3. **Per-channel masking weights:** Butteraugli reports separate low-/high-frequency masks per chroma channel — color sensitivity is wildly non-uniform (e.g., yellow-on-blue ≪ blue-on-yellow). Worth lifting the masking exponent (paper reports `~0.97` but in a hand-tuned regime) as initialization for our learned per-channel weights.

## 2. Multi-scale decomposition — Laplacian, Gabor, steerable, dilated

### Findings

- **HDR-VDP-2/3 + ColorVideoVDP**: steerable pyramid with multi-orientation filters at 5 scales, then a CSF-shaped weighting per band. CVVDP additionally uses transient/sustained channels for video; for stills the sustained channel is what we want.
- **FovVideoVDP**: same as CVVDP + an eccentricity weight (we can drop this — zensim is foveal only).
- **Butteraugli**: Laplacian pyramid + rotated line kernels for edge detection. Computed on original *and* a 2× downsampled copy.
- **NoR-VDPNet**: U-Net with **dilated dense blocks** (dilation = 3) as a cheap substitute for a steerable pyramid; ~95% of HDR-VDP-2 accuracy at 100× speed.
- **MS-SSIM**: 4-scale dyadic pyramid; canonical scale weights `[0.0448, 0.2856, 0.3001, 0.2363]` — these were tuned by Wang on natural images and are still widely used.
- **CPIPS**: extracts features from *multiple decoder stages* of a U-Net (not just the deepest), each channel-normalized and learned-linear-weighted. Achieves 50× speedup over LPIPS with 64–82% of accuracy.

### What zensim could do

The 228-feature input already includes some multi-scale info (tier 1/2/3 + dense percentiles on the `feat/dense-percentiles` branch). But it's **a flattened bag of statistics**, not a band-structured tensor.

1. **Reshape input to band-structured** if we ever move to a CNN backbone: e.g. group the 228 features into 4 dyadic scales of 57 features each, then a per-band weight (sigmoid-bounded `[0.5, 2.5]`) before the MLP. This adds 4 parameters but lets the MLP learn its own MS-SSIM-style scale weighting.
2. **Per-band auxiliary loss** during training: predict per-scale quality separately, then aggregate. Forces the model to use scale information. CPIPS shows this regularizes well.
3. **Dilated-conv head** as a Phase-3 experiment: replace the final 64-d hidden with a tiny dilated stack (dilation 1, 2, 4) over the band-structured input. Total parameter increase: ~4 k. Expected lift: matches NoR-VDPNet's claim of "≥95% of full HDR-VDP at 100× speed."

| CPIPS dilation | 3 | CPIPS §3.2 |

## 3. Pooling — mean, std, p-norm, max, info-weighted

This is the most empirically-supported lever in the corpus and probably the cheapest improvement we can make.

### Findings

- **GMSD** (Xue 2013) pools **the standard deviation of the local-quality map, not the mean.** PLCC ≈ 0.960 on LIVE — competitive with everything heavier — at *50× lower compute than FSIM* and *47× less than VIF*. The reasoning: humans rate images with *uneven* distortion (some regions sharp, some blurred) worse than *uniformly* distorted images at the same mean error. **Pure mean pooling literally cannot represent this.**
- **IW-SSIM** (Wang & Li 2010) pools by **information content** `w_i = log(1 + σ_i²)` per local patch. Upweights textured regions, downweights flat ones. SROCC on LIVE: 0.957, vs 0.948 for plain SSIM.
- **Butteraugli** uses **`max-norm` at high quality**, **`average of p-norms ∈ {3, 6, 12}`** at lower quality. The p-norm averaging is a notable trick — single high-p collapses to max, but averaging across exponents preserves both peak-error and broad-distortion sensitivity.
- **SSIMULACRA2** is reported (paper benchmarks, not its own source) as having **the strongest per-source PLCC (0.968) of any non-CVVDP metric on AIC-HDR2025**. Its pooling isn't fully disclosed in any OA paper I found, but the per-source consistency suggests a robust, possibly multi-norm composition.

### What zensim could do

1. **Emit a 4-vector instead of a 1-vector** from the MLP: `[μ, σ, max, p_6]` of the implicit per-feature quality signal. Then a 2-layer head reduces 4→1. Adds ~30 parameters; expected SROCC lift on CID22 ≥ +0.01 based on GMSD's gains. **Single highest-yield change in this doc.**
2. **Use std-pooling as an auxiliary loss head** during training: predict the *spread* of per-image MOS reports as a second target. Regularizes the embedding without changing the inference path.
3. **Try `mean of p-norm ∈ {3, 6, 12}`** explicitly on per-feature quality signals before the MLP. Costs nothing at inference (still scalar in/scalar out per feature), changes only how the 228-d vector is computed upstream.

## 4. Targets / supervision — multi-target loss, Thurstone, pairwise

This is the single most-cited *methodological* gap between zensim and the modern literature.

### Findings — what's wrong with scalar MSE on a fixed target

- **CID22 measures MOS (appeal); KonJND-1k measures PJND (imperceptibility threshold).** These are *different psychometric scales*: MOS is cardinal utility on `[1,5]`, PJND is a binary 75%-detection-probability threshold reconstructable to an ordinal `[-2.5, 0]` JND scale. A scalar MSE loss against ssim2 cannot align both at once.
- **MOS is set-dependent and noisy.** Multiple papers (PieAPP, BAPPS) explicitly argue pairwise preferences are more stable per-subject and across labs.
- **High-fidelity range (q ≥ 80) is where SSIM/PSNR saturate.** SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli, CVVDP all explicitly target this range. The AIC-3 protocol exists *because* MOS variance at q≥80 makes it nearly useless without boosting (artifact amplification, 10 Hz flicker, 2× zoom).

### The Thurstone Case V approach

- Define a latent quality scale `z_i ∈ ℝ` per image.
- Convert each labeled pair `(i, j) → P(i ≻ j)` into a likelihood under `Φ(d · (z_i − z_j))` where `Φ` is the standard-normal CDF.
- The **canonical psychometric constant** is `d · Φ⁻¹(0.75) = 1` → `d ≈ 0.6745`. This is the conversion factor between *z-score units* and *1-JND units*.
- Maximum likelihood gives `z_i` consistent across all paired comparisons (Mosteller / Thurstone 1927; reformulated by Bradley-Terry 1952 with a logistic instead of probit — equivalent in practice).
- Multiple papers (PieAPP, AIC-3, KonJND) use this; the AIC-3 paper achieves **95 % CI width ≈ 0.27 JND at 1 JND nominal** with this approach.

### What zensim could do

1. **Switch from MSE to a Thurstone/Bradley-Terry pairwise loss** as the primary signal:
   ```
   L = Σ_{(i,j)} [ y_ij · log Φ(d · (z_i − z_j)) + (1 − y_ij) · log(1 − Φ(...)) ]
   ```
   - For our 196 k synthetic pairs we already *have* pairwise structure (same reference, different distortion). Use it.
   - For CID22 / KADID we infer pairs from MOS deltas with a margin (e.g. `|MOS_i − MOS_j| > 0.3`).
   - For KonJND-1k we have explicit PJND thresholds → directly usable as ordinal anchors.
2. **Multi-target with KonJND aligned via Thurstone**, *not* via a separate scalar regression head. T11.20b currently bolts on a w=0.10 KonJND term as a second MSE. Doing it Thurstone-style keeps all three datasets on one latent scale.
3. **Two-stage train**: (1) Thurstone on pairs only → embedding. (2) Post-hoc spline calibration of `z → JND_units` using AIC-3 anchors at known JND levels (−1 JND ≈ NVL, −2.5 JND ≈ obvious artifact).
4. **Add a content-class auxiliary head** (lineart / screen / document / photo) — predict from same embedding. Multiple papers (CPIPS, multi-task SCI coding) report this as effective regularization at near-zero cost.

## 5. Architectural ideas worth porting

These are smaller, lower-priority changes but each pays for itself.

| # | Idea | Source | Cost | Expected lift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | **Confidence head** — second 1-d output from same embedding; trained with NLL of a Gaussian over MOS variance (CID22 has per-image σ; use it). | HDR-VDP-3 §4, ProxIQA | +30 params | Surfaces low-confidence cases; downstream filtering of unreliable predictions |
| 5.2 | **Mixture-of-experts gate** — k=4 experts (photo / lineart / screen / document) gated by a tiny softmax. T11.x has explored MoE on v06-moe branch; the literature confirms it for IQA (multi-task SCI paper). | T11 + multi-task SCI | +50 % params | +0.01–0.02 CID22 SROCC at edges of content distribution |
| 5.3 | **Frequency-weighting modulator** — per-band sigmoid-bounded weight per *codec*; predicted from a tiny codec-id head. CSF is not universal across codecs (JPEG blocking ≈ mid-freq, VVC smoothing ≈ low-freq). | IQNet §3; HDR-VDP-3 paper | +50 params | +0.01 CID22 per-codec correlation |
| 5.4 | **Spatial JND map output** — a 2-d head producing a per-region JND map, trained from KonJND++ click data (300 images, 129 click maps each). Then global JND = `−max(map)` or `−p_99(map)` (per literature). | Chen 2023 (Localization of JND) | +200 params (1×1 conv head) | Enables saliency-weighted downstream encoders; unlocks bit-allocation pickers |
| 5.5 | **Distortion-type auxiliary** — predict distortion-type label from embedding (cross-entropy). | Multi-task SCI paper; CPIPS | +60 params | Regularization; minor CID22 lift; major out-of-distribution robustness |

## 6. Algorithm specifics extracted from the corpus

### 6.1 Butteraugli — full pipeline as the OA papers describe it

```
RGB(linear) → [3×3 matrix] → LMS-ish → [biased-log, b≈0.01] → "butter space"
            → Laplacian pyramid (multiple scales)
            + rotated line kernels (line-structure detector)
            → low-freq mask = f(local |Δ chroma|)
            + high-freq mask = color-channel-selective
            → per-pixel error map
            → per-pixel max-norm OR mean of {p=3, 6, 12}-norms
            → geomean across image patches
            → distance ∈ ℝ⁺   (≈1.0 = JND at 1000 px viewing distance)
```

The exact masking constants are not in the OA paper text — they live in `google/butteraugli/butteraugli.cc`. We should grep them out and either lift them as priors or use them to sanity-check whatever we learn.

### 6.2 SSIMULACRA2 — what we can infer

No OA paper *defines* SSIMULACRA2 — it's documented in the libjxl repo only. From benchmarks (AIC-HDR2025, AIC-JPEG-AI):

- Per-source PLCC 0.968 (the only metric beating CVVDP on this axis)
- Overall PLCC 0.906 (3rd-best after CVVDP, HDR-VDP-3)
- Sensitive to compression artifacts specifically; sometimes *less* sensitive than Butteraugli to colour-only distortions
- Public source: `https://github.com/cloudinary/ssimulacra2`

We should add SSIMULACRA2 as a **target** in our supervision mix (alongside ssim2, IWSSIM, CVVDP), not as a feature input — its output is exactly what we want to predict.

### 6.3 Guetzli's optimization loop — relevant only because we're inside the picker

```
init_quant_table ← search over predefined tables to satisfy butter(orig, decoded) ≤ α · target
α = 0.97        # 3 % slack allows local refinement
loop:
  for each DCT coefficient, in zig-zag order:
    zero it
    if butter(orig, decoded) ≤ target: keep zeroed
    else: restore
until no improvement
```

For zensim this is mostly a *cautionary tale*: at the edge of perceptibility, the loss landscape is extremely flat. Loss surface design matters far more than gradient-method choice. This is why MSE-against-ssim2 will plateau and why pairwise/Thurstone with carefully-chosen pairs near threshold is the higher-yield approach.

### 6.4 HDR-VDP-2/3 — the calibration anchor

HDR-VDP-2 trained on LIVE + TID2008 (LDR). HDR-VDP-3 added UPIQ (4000+ images, joint LDR+HDR, unified JOD scale via Thurstone). **UPIQ is the largest existing JOD-aligned IQA dataset.** If we want a single dataset that exercises both SDR and HDR ranges on one consistent scale, UPIQ is it. Not yet in our training corpus.

### 6.5 VMAF — what's worth borrowing

- 4 features: VIF (visual information fidelity, 4 subbands), DLM (detail loss measure), motion (TI; meaningless for stills), and PSNR-Y as a sanity tail.
- Linear regression head fit via SVR with RBF kernel; Netflix uses the v0.6.1 weights.
- **Crucially: VMAF was trained on the *Netflix VMAF+ dataset* of 230 sequences only, and the resulting features generalize poorly to AV1 / HEVC.** (Per Enhancing-VMAF paper §2.3.) The lesson: even very good metrics need cross-codec training data.
- **VMAF-neg** (variant) hits PLCC 0.958 on JPEG-AI — for *learning-based* codecs, video-trained metrics out-perform image-IQA metrics. Suggests we should add **AV1/HEVC video frames** to our training corpus once we have time.

### 6.6 LPIPS / DISTS / PieAPP — feature-distance learned metrics

- All three extract features from a *pretrained* CNN backbone (VGG-16 conv1_2..conv5_3 is the LPIPS canonical choice), compute per-layer feature differences, weight them with a small learned linear layer per channel.
- **PieAPP** trains the *whole network* end-to-end on the BAPPS-style 2AFC dataset (200 refs × 75 distortion types × ~256 pairs per ref = 384 k pairwise comparisons).
- **DISTS** explicitly separates structure (`μ, σ` over feature maps) from texture (`μ` of features themselves) — robustness gain against textured-vs-blurred confusion.
- **CPIPS** ablates this: confirms multi-layer features beat any single layer; layer weights matter more than backbone choice; lightweight U-Net works almost as well as VGG at 50× speed.

We have most of the *features* equivalent of these in our 228-d input (the Tier 1/2/3 feature table is essentially a hand-engineered VGG-like statistics bank). We're missing the **pairwise training objective** and the **deep multi-layer view**. Both are addressable without a CNN backbone.

## 7. Corpus / data work to do

| Priority | Action | Cost | Win |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | **Add SSIMULACRA2 supervision target** to the unified training parquet. Score every (ref, dist) pair with `ssimulacra2 --orig ref --dist dist` once; store as a column. | ~24 h compute on 196 k pairs | Adds 4th supervision target; aligns with the metric most papers in the corpus call out as strongest per-source on AIC-HDR |
| P0 | **Add Butteraugli p-norm score** (and `--distance` max-norm) as additional target column. | ~12 h compute | Lets us train a multi-target loss that includes both Butteraugli AND SSIMULACRA2 — *what Jpegli already does for the JPEG encoder* |
| P0 | **Build the Thurstone pair file** from existing CSVs. Per reference image, all C(n,2) pairs with `Δssim2 > ε`. Save once; reuse for every Thurstone-loss experiment. | ~2 h | Unblocks every Thurstone-loss experiment below |
| P1 | **Ingest UPIQ dataset** (~4000 images, JOD-aligned across SDR+HDR). Public; widely used as the modern recalibration anchor. | ~1 d ingest + 3 d sweep | Single biggest content-distribution expansion available |
| P1 | **Ingest KonJND++** (300 images, 129 spatial-click maps per image). Public dataset; enables spatial JND map output (§5.4). | ~1 d | Unlocks spatial-map architecture |
| P2 | **AIC-HDR2025 + AIC-JPEG-AI** datasets. ~600 images total, full triplet-comparison data; recent (2024-2025) and codec-rich. | ~2 d | Closes the AIC-3 calibration gap |
| P2 | **CLIC + LIVE + KADID-10k + TID2013 + CSIQ** as a unified secondary anchor set. Already partially in `unified_v15`. | ~1 d | Strengthens out-of-distribution validation |
| P3 | **Programmatic distortion expansion** of own corpus to >75 distortion types (PieAPP-style). Currently the synthetic corpus is heavy on JPEG/WebP/AVIF/JXL artifacts; under-represents Gaussian noise, blur, contrast/brightness shifts, color shifts, JPEG2000 ringing. | ~3 d generation + score | Broadens the embedding's coverage and likely fixes out-of-distribution failures |

## 8. Concrete experiment slate

Numbered for cross-reference. Each is sized for a Phase-3-style cycle.

### High priority (CID22 / KonJND / AIC-3 simultaneous gains)

**EX-1. Thurstone loss replacement.** Replace the current scalar-MSE loss in `zensim-validate` with a Thurstone-Bradley-Terry pairwise loss over `(ref, dist_i, dist_j)` triplets from the synthetic corpus. Initial guess: drop the existing scalar regression entirely.
- *Expected*: CID22 SROCC ≥ 0.83, KonJND SROCC ≥ 0.92, AIC-3 SROCC ≥ 0.85 simultaneously. T11.20b achieves 0.7986 / 0.9219 / 0.79 — should be a clear improvement on the worst two.
- *Effort*: 2 days code + 1 day per 5-seed sweep.

**EX-2. Std-pooling head.** Add `[μ, σ, max, p₆]` as a 4-vector output of the feature aggregator, then a 4→1 reducer.
- *Expected*: +0.01 CID22 SROCC, free.
- *Effort*: half a day.

**EX-3. SSIMULACRA2 multi-target.** Add SSIMULACRA2 score as a 4th target alongside ssim2/IWSSIM/CVVDP, weighted 0.25/0.25/0.25/0.25.
- *Expected*: closes the AIC-3 0.79 → 0.85+ gap (SSIMULACRA2 is the AIC-3 winner among non-CVVDP metrics).
- *Effort*: 1 day scoring + 1 day training.

**EX-4. XYB / biased-log front-end.** Apply a 3×3 LMS-ish matrix + biased-log transfer before feature extraction.
- *Expected*: +0.005–0.015 CID22 SROCC; bigger lift on chroma-dominant distortions.
- *Effort*: 2 days (have to update the feature extractor and re-bench).

### Medium priority

**EX-5. Spatial JND head from KonJND++.** Add a 1×1-conv head producing a per-region JND map. Global JND = `−p_99(map)`.
- *Expected*: enables saliency-weighted downstream encoders. Doesn't necessarily move the headline SROCC but unlocks the *picker* and *encoder* loops to consume zensim's output.
- *Effort*: 3 days.

**EX-6. Codec-conditional frequency weighting.** Tiny codec-id-conditional per-band weight module.
- *Expected*: +0.01–0.02 per-codec SROCC, particularly on JPEG vs VVC vs JPEG-XL.
- *Effort*: 2 days.

**EX-7. Mixture-of-experts.** k=4 experts gated by content class (photo / lineart / screen / document).
- *Expected*: marginal improvement at distribution edges; this is the v06-moe branch — finish it.
- *Effort*: 3 days.

### Low priority but worth tracking

**EX-8. Confidence head with NLL loss.** Second output predicts variance; trained against per-image MOS spread.
- *Expected*: no SROCC change; enables downstream filtering of unreliable predictions.
- *Effort*: 1 day.

**EX-9. UPIQ ingest + recalibration sweep.**
- *Expected*: rationalizes joint SDR+HDR scale; sets up Phase-4 HDR work.
- *Effort*: 1 week.

**EX-10. PieAPP-scale distortion expansion** (75+ distortion types).
- *Expected*: out-of-distribution robustness; marginal change on existing benchmarks.
- *Effort*: 1-2 weeks.

## 9. Anti-patterns explicitly called out in the literature

Worth pasting verbatim into our own CLAUDE.md anti-pattern list:

1. **"Don't train a metric on one set and test on another *without* aligning the scales."** Multiple papers report PLCC drops of 0.1–0.2 from this alone. The fix is INLSA recalibration (Iterated Nested Least-Squares Alignment) between two datasets' scales before treating them jointly.
2. **"Don't take the *mean* of a local quality map."** GMSD made its name proving this. *Std* of the map is what humans rate. Same evidence appears in 4–5 other places in the corpus.
3. **"Don't apply SDR metrics to HDR luminance without PU encoding."** *Every* HDR-VDP paper opens with this warning. PSNR on raw HDR luminance is essentially noise.
4. **"RGB-domain metrics fail on HDR."** Use luminance-only or PU-encoded chroma + luma separately.
5. **"Don't trust val-loss as a proxy for held-out CID22 SROCC."** zenanalyze leak audit confirmed this: V0_5 had val_mean 0.99 *and* 11.77 % training contamination. Per-seed CID22 SROCC is the only honest signal.
6. **"Don't use the same metric as both target and feature."** ssim2 as both a training target and an input feature is structurally degenerate. (Currently zensim does some of this; verify.)
7. **"Don't optimize aggregate (KADID + TID + CID22) / 3 SROCC."** Hides CID22 regressions. CID22 is gold standard; others are integrity guards.
8. **"Don't ship a metric calibrated to one viewing-distance assumption without documenting it."** Butteraugli ships with 1000-px viewing-distance assumption; if your encoder targets mobile (~3000 px viewing), you'll over-spend bits.

---

## 10. The roadmap, if I were doing only this

(Provided as a useful one-glance answer; the *actual* roadmap depends on T11.x decisions.)

1. **Land EX-1 + EX-2 + EX-3** in one V_24 sweep. These don't conflict with each other and together address the biggest gaps. Expect ~2-3 weeks calendar.
2. **EX-4 (XYB front-end)** as V_25 because it touches feature extraction and is moderately invasive.
3. **EX-5 + EX-6** as V_26 — these are about *outputs*, not the embedding. Doing them after the embedding is stable is the right order.
4. **EX-9 (UPIQ)** as soon as we have HDR encoder work landing. Until then, keep it on the backlog.
5. **Everything else** is opportunistic.

The single highest-yield change in this entire document is **EX-1 (Thurstone loss replacement)** — it changes how the model learns from the data we *already* have, requires no new ingest, and structurally aligns three benchmarks (CID22, KonJND, AIC-3) that are currently in tension. If only one experiment from this doc lands, this is it.

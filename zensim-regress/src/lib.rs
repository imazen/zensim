//! Visual regression testing persistence and workflow for zensim.
//!
//! This crate provides checksum file management, architecture-aware
//! tolerance handling, and pixel hashing for visual regression testing. It
//! builds on `zensim`'s `RegressionReport` and `ErrorCategory` to create a
//! complete chain-of-trust system for tracking expected test outputs.
//!
//! # Format
//!
//! `.checksums` — line-oriented log files via [`checksums`]. Compact,
//! append-friendly, one file per test module with human-readable memorable names.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use zensim_regress::checksums::ChecksumManager;
//! use zensim_regress::hasher::SeaHasher;
//! use zensim_regress::hasher::ChecksumHasher;
//! use zensim_regress::arch::detect_arch_tag;
//!
//! // Hash an actual test output
//! let hasher = SeaHasher;
//! let hash = hasher.hash_file(std::path::Path::new("test_output.png")).unwrap();
//!
//! println!("arch: {}, hash: {}", detect_arch_tag(), hash);
//! ```

"""Summer-gauntlet INTERACTIVE dashboard builder — the ``--fulleval-dir`` mode of
``bandwise_dashboard.py`` (user 2026-07-26: "interactively compare all the summer's best bakes,
with correlation scatterplots for every reference — MOS, JND, ssim2, butteraugli, cvvdp").

It reads the per-bake ``*.fulleval.json`` files (schema + fixtures: ``make_stub_fulleval.py``)
and emits ONE self-contained, offline HTML page with:

  * a toggle bar (checkbox per bake — hide/show it across EVERY chart; stable color per bake),
  * a SORTABLE scoreboard table (click any header to sort by CID22 / KonJND / dial-mono / M3 /
    corruption-detection / composite / …),
  * the correlation SCATTER MATRIX — for the selected reference, one clean scatter per
    (bake x corpus) with an OLS fit line + canonical SROCC/PLCC annotated, faceted so bakes sit
    side by side per corpus,
  * a cross-corpus SROCC heatmap and a CID22-vs-{nonphoto,KonJND} operating-point trade map,
  * the JXL loop-targeting panel (2026-08-01): 2-shot/3-shot within-±2 scoreboard columns
    (emit-best, bakes mapped via ``LOOP_BAKE_MAP``) + a section table of every loop model
    (emit-last detail, outer arms, ssim2), fed verbatim by the jxl-encoder sweep summary
    JSON (``--loop-targeting``; counts/medians are READ, never re-derived here).

ENSEMBLE rows (2026-08-04): a fulleval JSON carrying ``model.kind == "ensemble"`` (stamped by
``scripts/promote_fulleval.py --members``) renders an ``ens×k`` marker everywhere the bake is
named, and its Model-details card leads with a warning that the architecture/repro shown is the
ANCHOR member. An ensemble is an evaluation FUNCTION, not a shippable artifact — its rank/dial/
corruption numbers come from the identical verdict invocation as every single-bake row and are
directly comparable, but ``m3_coherence``/``m3a_coherence`` are **null** because the coherence
instrument loads one ZNPR. Null renders as an em-dash (NOT MEASURED) and is excluded from column
shading and min/max — it is never displayed or shaded as a measured zero.

NO external requests: all CSS/JS/data are inlined (no CDN, no web fonts) so the file opens
offline. NO hand-rolled statistics: every SROCC/PLCC comes from the canonical ``panel`` (via the
fulleval JSON's precomputed ``scatter`` block, or computed at build through
``scripts/lib/zen_stats.panel`` when a JSON omits it). Only OLS fit-line endpoints are computed
here (numpy polyfit — a display aid, like bake_report.py), never an IQA stat.

Colors follow the dataviz skill's validated categorical palette (see the palette validator run in
the commit); identity is never color-alone — every series is labeled and the table view exists.

# ---- SEED GROUPS -------------------------------------------------------------------
# A board cell is one TRAINING RUN. Several cells can be draws of the SAME recipe at
# different seeds, and a headline quoted from the best of them is a best-of-k statistic
# reported as if it were the recipe's value. MEASURED on this board's own control arm
# (benchmarks/fastclass_distill_wave_2026-09-04.md §7.1): A4b's published KonJND 0.4327
# and composite 0.8664 are the best of 3 seeds; the same recipe's mean is 0.3561 /
# 0.8572 and its KonJND seed spread is 0.133.
#
# THE GROUPING RULE (this function is the board's owner of it; `freeze_check --select`
# is adding a `--seed-group` key concurrently and MUST adopt the identical rule — see
# the doc's "pending unification" note):
#   1. Only single-model rows participate. An ensemble is an evaluation FUNCTION over
#      members, not a training replicate of anything.
#   2. Key = the embedded `zentrain.repro.argv` with `--seed` and the output-path flags
#      (and their values) removed. No argv -> UNGROUPABLE (and it also fails criterion
#      (a), since no argv means no embedded repro).
#   3. Rows inside a key are collapsed by SEED IDENTITY (`seed_identity`): two cells with
#      the SAME recipe
#      and the SAME seed are one training run promoted twice (MEASURED: 33 such pairs on
#      this board, e.g. A4b_s4004 / FC_C0_s4004 — identical argv modulo seed, identical
#      seed 4004, CID22 identical to 16 digits, different bake sha). So k = the number
#      of DISTINCT seeds, never the number of board rows.
# VALIDATION: this rule reproduces §7.1's numbers exactly on its own arm — k=3,
# KonJND best 0.4327 / mean 0.3561 / spread 0.1329, composite best 0.8664 / mean 0.8572.
#
# MIRRORED IN RUST (2026-09-04): `freeze_check --select --seed-group` implements the same
# three clauses — `norm_argv_for_seed_group` / `seed_group_key` / `seed_identity` in
# zensim-validate/src/bin/freeze_check.rs, sha1 and all, so a `--select` group id and a
# board `seed_group` id are the SAME STRING. `scripts/verify_seed_group_parity.py` is the
# gate: it runs both owners over the board's fulleval dir and fails on any disagreement in
# normalized argv, key, seed identity, or the resulting k>=2 partitions. ONE deliberate
# divergence, and only one: `build_seed_groups` returns k>=2 groups because the board
# renders k=1 rows through another path, while `--select` must rank every candidate it was
# handed and so keeps ungroupable/single-seed cells as labelled singletons.
#
# HOW A GROUP IS PRESENTED (USER CORRECTION, 2026-09-04, verbatim): *"data-subsets are
# not equal though — one might be more representative and diverse, while another sucks,
# objectively."* A seed drives pair SAMPLING, so a seed's subset can be objectively
# better- or worse-covered, and part of the spread is subset coverage rather than model
# variance. Consequences the board must honour, and does:
#   * the group is shown as MEAN + SPREAD (min-max) + k, with the PER-SEED values
#     reachable (hover, and every member row stays on the board),
#   * the mean ranks the default view — it is the honest estimator against best-of-k —
#     but it is NEVER labelled definitive,
#   * the badge says so, in `SEED_COVERAGE_NOTE`,
#   * when a bake carries `zentrain.sample_coverage` the board renders it beside the
#     seed. It LANDED 2026-09-04 (the trainer embeds it; `bake_verdict` surfaces it at
#     `repro.sample_coverage`, which is exactly where this file reads it), so bakes
#     trained from that commit on carry it and every earlier board row does not —
#     absent renders NOT MEASURED, never a zero.

# Equivalence gate for the cross-codec driver consolidation (issue #41 Tier-1 #3).
#
# The nine run_cross_codec_v<N>_seed.sh scripts are now shims over one recipe
# (run_cross_codec_seed.sh + cross_codec_variants/<N>.conf). This test proves the
# consolidation did not change what any of them runs: each shim is rendered in
# CC_DRY_RUN=1 mode and diffed against cross_codec_variants/golden/<N>.args —
# the argv captured from the PRE-consolidation scripts at commit e9a705c0.
#
# Needs no data, no trainer, and no network. Runs anywhere bash does.
#

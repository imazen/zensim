# G-ADDR board re-grade — run the gate over every FAIR board cell under BOTH
# negative-tail pin sets, then graft the result onto the board fullevals.

# WHY IT EXISTS. The 2026-09-04 board grading was done by an ad-hoc loop that
# was never committed, so re-running it after the 2026-09-05 tail re-pin meant
# reconstructing 97 invocations by hand. This script reads them back out of that
# run's own as-run LOGS — which record the bake, the ensemble members, the
# features root and the dial grid verbatim — so the re-grade is provably the
# SAME invocation with one flag changed, not a fresh guess at what was run.
#
# Binaries come from the MAIN repo (never a sibling worktree — those get cleaned
# up and take committed scripts down with them); override with ZL_BV.

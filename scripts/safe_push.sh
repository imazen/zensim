#!/usr/bin/env bash
# safe_push.sh — the ONLY sanctioned way to advance a tracked bookmark in this repo.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# `jj bookmark set main -r @ && jj git push --bookmark main` is a NON-fast-forward
# push whenever `@` does not descend from `main@origin`. jj performs it without a
# prompt, and the push succeeds: the bookmark simply MOVES SIDEWAYS and every commit
# that was only reachable from the old tip is silently unreachable from the new one.
# Nothing errors. Nothing warns. The commits still exist as local objects, so
# `jj log` on the pushing lane looks fine — the loss is only visible to whoever
# later asks "is my commit an ancestor of origin/main?".
#
# MEASURED, 2026-09-04: origin/main moved sideways TWICE in one afternoon (16:58:53
# and 17:08:29 UTC-6), and the second move dropped NINE commits from six lanes,
# including `d3a948ca` (the G-ADDR board-coverage feature, +555/-23 across six
# files). The boards on /mnt/v had been generated WITH that code, so the next
# regen from main would have silently un-drawn 46 NOT-SHIPPABLE badges. Full
# incident record: benchmarks/push_clobber_2026-09-05.md.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES
# --------------
#   fetch -> assert <bookmark>@origin is an ANCESTOR of the target
#         -> hygiene: address/identifier check on the outgoing diff
#         -> set -> push -> verify
#
# The second gate scans the lines this push would ADD for the identifier classes
# that must not enter a public repo (see scripts/lib/hygiene_patterns.txt for the
# patterns and the reasoning). It exits 7 -- a DIFFERENT code from the sideways
# refusal below, so a caller can tell the two apart -- and, like the first gate,
# it has no bypass flag.
#
# The assertion is not a warning. If any commit is reachable from <bookmark>@origin
# but NOT from the target, this script prints every one of them and exits 3 WITHOUT
# touching the bookmark. There is no --force. Recover with:
#     jj git fetch && jj rebase -d <bookmark>@origin      # then re-run safe_push
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/safe_push.sh                       # push @ (or @- if @ is empty) to main
#   scripts/safe_push.sh -r <rev>              # push an explicit revision
#   scripts/safe_push.sh -b <bookmark>         # a bookmark other than main
#   scripts/safe_push.sh --dry-run             # run every check, push nothing
#   scripts/safe_push.sh --self-test           # build a throwaway repo and prove
#                                              #   a sideways target is REFUSED and
#                                              #   a flagged identifier is REFUSED
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0 pushed (or --dry-run/--self-test passed)   4 fetch failed
#   2 bad usage / unresolvable revision          5 bookmark set or push failed
#   3 REFUSED: not a fast-forward                6 push reported success but did not land
#                                                7 REFUSED: hygiene check on the outgoing diff

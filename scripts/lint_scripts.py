"""Fail the build on scripts that cannot possibly run.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-07-15 an audit of `scripts/v_next/` found 25 of 130
scripts pinned to binaries in sibling worktrees that had since been deleted
(`zensim--cross-codec-metric`, `--v10`, `--eval-accel`, `--picker-train`, ...).
They had been unrunnable for weeks. One more (`metric_compare_report.py`) had
not *parsed* since a bulk sed inserted an unescaped `<meta charset="utf-8">`
into a Python string literal — also unnoticed, because nobody ran it.

The mechanism is structural, not careless:

  1. an agent opens sibling worktree `zensim--foo`
  2. it writes a script hardcoding `<zen>/zensim--foo/target/release/bar`
  3. the worktree is cleaned up (correctly! the cleanup rule is mandatory)
  4. the script stays, permanently dead, and nothing notices

(That example is spelled `<zen>/` rather than the literal path because the
2026-07-15 mass-repoint sed — `zensim--*` -> `zensim` across 69 files — rewrote
this very docstring and silently deleted the illustration. Bulk seds do not
read context. That is the same mechanism that left `metric_compare_report.py`
unparseable for weeks.)

CLAUDE.md's worktree-cleanup rule covers the worktree. It does not cover the
scripts that pointed INTO it. This linter closes that gap: a dead reference
fails here instead of rotting for weeks and inflating the directory into
something nobody can read.

    python3 scripts/lint_scripts.py            # report + exit 1 on failure
    python3 scripts/lint_scripts.py --list     # report only, always exit 0

Checks:
  PARSE     — the file is valid Python
  DEAD-WT   — references a `zensim--*` sibling worktree that no longer exists
  DEAD-BIN  — hardcodes a `target/{release,debug}/...` path that does not exist
              AND whose source cannot be found
  DEAD-SCRIPT — shells to a `scripts/...` path that does not exist (this is the
              cross-language edge: a .sh calling a deleted .py)
  DEAD-LINK / DEAD-REF — a README under scripts/ indexes a file that is gone.
              The index is how people find tools; when it rots it sends the
              next session to rebuild something that already exists.
  WIN-PATH  — a tracked filename Windows cannot check out at all
  CONFLICT  — a leaked git/jj conflict-marker line (see check_conflict_markers
              below for the exact forms) in any tracked text file, not just
              scripts/ -- a conflict "resolved" by hand that missed a line
  HYGIENE   — hygiene: address/identifier check. Any tracked text file matching
              a class in scripts/lib/hygiene_patterns.txt, which is the SAME
              file scripts/safe_push.sh reads for its pre-push gate, so the two
              can never drift into checking different things. That gate scans
              the outgoing diff; this scans the whole tracked tree, which is how
              an inherited hit gets found rather than only a newly added one.

A hardcoded build artifact under THIS repo's own `target/` is only a warning:
it may simply not be built yet. A path under a *deleted worktree* is fatal —
that one can never come back.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-05 two lanes each committed Markdown
    (CHANGELOG.md, benchmarks/INDEX.md) carrying a stray trailing
    `>>>>>>> conflict 1 of 1 ends` -- a jj conflict resolved by hand that
    missed its own closing marker line. Both were caught only by a human
    re-reading the file later, and fixed by hand. Nothing had checked for
    this class of defect; this closes the gap the same way DEAD-WT/DEAD-BIN
    close theirs -- scan on every push instead of trusting a resolve to be
    complete.

    Binary files are skipped by a NUL sniff over their first
    BINARY_SNIFF_BYTES (a `.bin` bake, a `.parquet` sidecar, an image -- none
    of these are meant to be read as text, and a coincidental hit inside one
    is noise, not signal). `.orig`/`.rej` files are skipped outright: patch
    and merge tooling legitimately writes literal diff/conflict markers into
    those by design, and nobody intends to commit them clean.

    Unlike the scripts/-only checks above, this scans every tracked path in
    the whole repo -- a leaked marker is exactly as real in a doc or a Rust
    source file as it is in a script.

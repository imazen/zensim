#             grade an EXISTING bake (a shipped profile, a prior arm) with no
#             rebuild. `regime` is 372 (default) / 720 / 944.
#
# Both modes end in the SAME `grade` function, so a re-grade after a bar change
# can never accidentally be a different measurement from the build-time one.
#
# Binaries come from the MAIN repo (never a sibling worktree — those get cleaned
# up and take committed scripts down with them); override with ZL_BV / ZL_BDR.
#
# ERA. `ZL_ERA` selects WHICH 372 instruments + features root the grade reads.
# The default `canonical` is the 2026-09-04 set and is byte-unchanged.
#   canonical  the 2026-05-29 grid + the 2026-09-04 probes + the DEFAULT root.
#              The grid's own pixels no longer exist (decode cache deleted
#              2026-06-22) and the root predates option C, so this reads the
#              published era, NOT the shipped runtime's.
#   postC      the 2026-09-05 re-extraction at HEAD -- THE RUNTIME ERA.
#   preC       the same pixels extracted at 27cfde15, the commit immediately
#              before option C. Exists so `postC - preC` is an era measurement
#              with the pixels held fixed.
#   ladder     the 2026-09-05 FLOOR-DENSE instrument: each codec's own lowest
#              DISTINCT settings at the bottom (jpeg emits ONE bitstream for
#              every q in 0..10, so the older grids' bottom three jpeg steps are
#              one setting sampled three times), and TWO avif ladders. Carries
#              its own peer_ssim2 bars, keyed by grid sha256.
# Individual overrides (ZL_GRID / ZL_NEGTAIL / ZL_IDENTITY / ZL_ROOT / ZL_OUT)
# still win, so a one-off instrument needs no new era name.

//! `zensim_validate::feature_set` — deriving a feature-set id for a BAKE and

//! Design: `docs/FEATURE_SET_IDS.md`. Registry:

//! The class under test has two published instances: `ebothg_m504` (a

//! with 49 structurally-used lines in `f156..371`, scored at `--regime 944`
//! where that block is STRUCTURAL ZEROS, reading CID22 **0.3862** against its
//! true **0.8764**. No error, no warning, a plausible number half a point low.

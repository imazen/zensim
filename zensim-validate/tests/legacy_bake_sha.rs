//! Byte-identity control for the output-polarity owner (`OutputPolarity`).
//!
//! Five legacy RANK-ONLY recipes — the convention every board bake trained
//! under — must be unaffected by the 2026-09-06 change that gave output
//! polarity one owner, honoured `--tv-margin` on the plain path, and threaded
//! the sign into both mini-batch helpers.
//!
//! ⚠ **THE CLAIM IS NARROWER THAN "every rank-only recipe".** Review 2026-09-06
//! found one rank-only shape that DOES move: the α head's monotonicity hinge was
//! written for SCORE (`violation = y_lo − y_hi + margin`) and is now written for
//! the run's declared polarity, so under `Distance` it is the OPPOSITE hinge and
//! its gradients flip with it. That is the fix, not a regression — the old form
//! was fighting the same path's own RankNet term — but it means a
//! `--per-sample-alpha-head --monotonicity-reg > 0` recipe with no absolute term
//! changes bytes. `ALPHA_RANK_MONO` below pins that arm at its POST-fix digest
//! and says so, rather than leaving the gap uncovered.
//!
//! Blast radius, checked: all 10 stored recipes carrying `monotonicity_reg > 0`
//! also carry `mse_weight ∈ {0.6, 1.0}` (including shipped Profile A's
//! `v47_strict`), which derives SCORE — and under Score the new expression
//! reduces to the old one exactly. No stored bake moves.
//!
//! ## Why this is an in-process A/B, not a pinned cross-machine digest (2026-09-06)
//!
//! The original version of this file asserted `bake_sha(recipe) ==
//! <sha measured on this repo's Zen 4 / AVX-512 dev box at `main@origin`
//! `0c6307a7`, the parent of the polarity-owner commit>`. CI run 34051799424
//! showed that comparison fails on EVERY runner class it touches — ubuntu,
//! ubuntu-arm, macos-intel (x2), macos-arm, windows, windows-arm — with the
//! identical `(sha, len)` pair on all seven, none of which match the pinned
//! value. A trained MLP bake is not bit-reproducible across SIMD
//! tiers/platforms (FMA fusion, reduction order and vector width all vary the
//! rounding of the same arithmetic — the same phenomenon already documented for
//! feature extraction under "v1 golden byte-identity gate environment
//! fragility" in this repo's `CLAUDE.md`), so a digest captured on one machine
//! class can only ever pass there. That is a test-design defect, not a code
//! defect: nothing about the recipes moved between commits, only the box the
//! test happened to run on.
//!
//! The replacement is two arms that run **in-process, on whatever machine is
//! executing the test**, so a platform's own SIMD/FP rounding cancels out of
//! the comparison instead of being compared against a foreign machine's:
//!
//! 1. **STRUCTURAL** — `OutputPolarity::for_groups` must resolve every one of
//!    the five recipes to `Distance`, and `Distance`'s multipliers
//!    (`rank_target_sign`, `ladder_sign`) must be the exact IEEE-754 identity
//!    (`1.0`). Every line the refactor touched has the shape
//!    `target = rank_target_sign * quality_sign`,
//!    `viol = ladder_sign * (y_hi - y_lo) + margin` (margin `0.0` for these
//!    recipes), or `scale = scale * ladder_sign` — multiplying or adding the
//!    exact identity element changes no bit, on any machine, so this is the
//!    decision-table fact that makes "nothing moved" true, checked directly
//!    instead of inferred from a hash match.
//! 2. **DETERMINISM** — each recipe is trained twice in the same process and
//!    must produce byte-identical output. This is the "same run" half of the
//!    A/B: it catches non-determinism (thread races, iteration-order
//!    dependence) that a single-shot digest comparison can't distinguish from
//!    "the recipe moved".
//!
//! Together these stand in for "train the recipe through the pre-refactor code
//! path and the post-refactor code path in one run" — the literal pre-refactor
//! function no longer exists in this tree to call (it was replaced, not
//! feature-flagged), so the A/B instead proves the two facts whose conjunction
//! implies byte-for-byte equality with whatever the pre-refactor code produced:
//! the refactor's own multiplier is a no-op for this recipe class (1), and
//! training is a pure function of its inputs on this machine (2). If either
//! fails on a CI platform, that is a real polarity regression — fix the owner,
//! never relax this gate.
//!
//! The original pinned Zen 4 / AVX-512 digests are KEPT as a same-class check,
//! gated behind the `ZENSIM_ZEN4_GOLDEN_BAKE_SHA` env var so the decision to
//! run them is visible in the chain (CI workflow → `just legacy-bake-zen4-
//! golden` → this test), never a silent runtime skip: with the var unset
//! (every CI platform today) the test prints why it isn't checking PINNED and
//! moves on; with it set (only the `just` recipe, meant for the Zen 4 box that
//! measured PINNED) it asserts against them exactly as before.

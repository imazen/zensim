//! Two-layer MLP trainer for V0_4.
//!
//! Architecture: `n_features → n_hidden (LeakyReLU) → 1 (Identity)`.
//! Loss: RankNet pairwise (sigmoid cross-entropy on signed distance
//! deltas). Optimizer: Adam with cosine annealing.
//!
//! Output: a ZNPR v3 byte stream that loads via
//! `zensim::mlp::Model::from_bytes` (the `zensim::mlp` module re-exports
//! `zenpredict::Model`).
//!
//! This is the runtime-side counterpart to zenpicker's Python
//! distillation pipeline (`tools/train_hybrid.py`). Pure Rust, no
//! external numerics deps — the network is small enough (228×32 +
//! 32 = ~7.3K weights) that hand-rolled Adam is plenty fast.
//!
//! ## Multi-dataset training (V0_4 lessons from V0_2 audit)
//!
//! V0_2 was trained on a single concordant synthetic dataset; CMA-ES
//! hit higher synthetic SROCC than the shipped NM weights but lost
//! on KADIK / TID human holdouts. The takeaway for V0_4: ruthlessly
//! gate on human-dataset SROCC, not synthetic.
//!
//! This trainer takes [`TrainingGroup`]s with explicit `train_weight`.
//! Groups with `train_weight > 0` contribute to RankNet pair sampling
//! in proportion to their weight; groups with `train_weight == 0` are
//! validation-only — their per-epoch SROCC is logged and the best
//! model is the one with the highest validation mean.

//! freeze_check — the freeze-bar PASS/FAIL summary over one bake's fulleval
//! JSON: the single decision surface for the permanent-metric freeze.
//!
//! Bars come from `zenpapers:docs/zensim-final-metric-plan-2026-07-31.md` §5
//! (every bar's precedent is cited there); the owner-per-gate audit is
//! `benchmarks/decision_surface_audit_2026-07-31.md`. Rows whose measuring
//! owner lives OUTSIDE the verdict/fulleval pipeline (UPIQ, Korshunov, perf,
//! LOO, corruption ORDERING) are printed as ATTACH rows — evidence to bring,
//! never silently omitted. No stat is computed here: this bin only compares
//! numbers the owning tools already produced (no-duplication rule).
//!
//! Input: the FULLEVAL variant of the verdict JSON (i.e. after
//! `scripts/run_full_eval.sh` injects `m3a_coherence`); a raw `--full-json`
//! also works, with the injected rows degrading to ATTACH.
//!
//! Named profiles (`--profile`): a profile is a REGISTERED floor set — a
//! second decision surface that never edits the default §5 bars. The one
//! profile today is `balanced-2026-08-04` (sota944 campaign AMENDMENT 8, the
//! user-directed balanced-selection pass: floors F1–F8 + the registered
//! `balanced_composite`, frozen in `benchmarks/sota944_campaign_2026-08-03.md`
//! §8.1 BEFORE any scoring). `--tsv` / `--tsv-header` emit the machine row for
//! the pool matrix driver (`scripts/sota944_balanced_matrix.sh`).
//!
//! Exit: 0 = every evaluable row passes; 1 = at least one FAIL; 2 = usage /
//! parse error. ATTACH rows never fail the exit — they are pending evidence,
//! and the table says so out loud. In the balanced profile, a floor axis
//! ABSENT from the fulleval counts as not-passed (a candidate nobody measured
//! cannot be certified balanced on that axis).

         ranked separately, never penalized) / UNMEASURED (listed, NOT\n\
         selectable) — a missing measurement is never scored as zero. sdr25\n\
         is a reported comparator, not part of the rule. Exit 1 if no\n\
         candidate is selectable.\n\
         --seed-group (2026-09-04, §7.7 fix; opt-in, --select only): without\n\
         it, --select ranks INDIVIDUAL cells and on a class with real seed\n\
         spread will select the lucky draw — literally the best-of-k seed,\n\
         not the recipe's typical behavior. With it, cells are grouped by\n\
         RECIPE and GROUPS are ranked by the same PRIMARY/TIE-BREAK rule\n\
         computed over the k-seed MEAN, with each group's per-seed\n\
         selection_composite spread (min–max) and every per-seed value\n\
         printed alongside.\n\
         The grouping rule is NOT a flag: it is DERIVED from each fulleval's\n\
         embedded zentrain.repro, mirroring the board's owner\n\
         (scripts/v_next/gauntlet.py seed_group_key, fair_gauntlet §1.1) so a\n\
         --select group and a board group are the same handle. Key =\n\
         sha1(repro.argv minus the seed and output-path flags)[:12];\n\
         duplicate promotions of one training run collapse by seed identity,\n\
         so k = DISTINCT SEEDS, never cells. An ensemble or a cell with no\n\
         embedded argv is UNGROUPABLE — listed as its own group and labelled,\n\
         never silently merged or dropped; a grouped cell with k=1 is\n\
         UNREPLICATED (one draw, not an estimate).\n\
         THE MEAN IS NOT THE GROUP'S TRUE SCORE. A seed drives pair\n\
         SAMPLING, so members saw objectively different subsets; the mean is\n\
         the honest estimator against best-of-k, never a definitive value.\n\
         Read spread + per-seed rows with it (and a bake's own\n\
         zentrain.sample_coverage for what it actually touched).\n\
         Prints an ADDITIONAL section after the unchanged per-cell table;\n\
         exit code reflects the SEED-GROUP winner.\n\
         --min-k N (REGISTERED AMENDMENT 2026-09-05, default 2): the\n\
         REPLICATION FLOOR. A seed group with fewer than N distinct seeds is\n\
         UNREPLICATED -- listed and ranked in its own section, never\n\
         selected. Active by default, which also turns the seed-grouped\n\
         section on (it is the basis of the pick) and makes the selection a\n\
         RECIPE rather than a cell. Measured reason: replicating the board\n\
         leaders moved them DOWN (LSTAR 0.8615 best cell -> 0.856414 at k=7)\n\
         and best-of-k minus k-mean has a +0.0061 median over the 18\n\
         combined-fair k>=2 groups, larger than the 0.0021 separating the top\n\
         four (benchmarks/replication_wave_2026-09-05.md). --min-k 1 turns\n\
         the floor off entirely, for reproducing a historical selection.\n\
         --floor-basis all|mean (default all): how a GROUP's floor count is\n\
         computed -- `all` = floors EVERY distinct-seed representative\n\
         passes (a floor is a certification, and a mean is not one: two\n\
         members at 8/8 and 6/8 average 7.0 even when they fail DIFFERENT\n\
         floors, crediting a floor no member reliably clears); `mean` = the\n\
         k-seed mean, the pre-amendment basis. The mean is reported either\n\
         way. Neither flag can admit a candidate the pre-amendment rule\n\

// ── `--select --seed-group`: the k-seed AGGREGATE selection rule
// (2026-09-04 owner-fix lane, `benchmarks/fastclass_distill_wave_2026-09-04.md`
// §7.7) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// §7.7 measured that the plain `--select` rule above ranks INDIVIDUAL
// fulleval cells with no seed awareness, so on a model class with real
// seed-to-seed spread (0.133 KonJND on that wave's cells) it systematically
// selects the lucky draw — literally the control's best-of-3 seed, not its
// typical behavior. This is that fix: an OPT-IN mode (`--seed-group`) that
// aggregates cells into seed groups before ranking, so a group's score is
// its k-seed MEAN, with the per-seed spread reported alongside rather than
// thrown away.
//
// ══ ONE OWNER OF "WHAT IS A SEED GROUP" ══
//
// The grouping rule is NOT this file's to invent. `scripts/v_next/gauntlet.py`
// (`seed_group_key` / `build_seed_groups`, `benchmarks/fair_gauntlet_2026-09-04
// .md` §1.1) owns it for the board, and it was validated there by reproducing
// the fastclass §7.1 table blind (k=3, KonJND best 0.4327 / mean 0.3561 /
// spread 0.1329). A `--select` winner and a board leader disagreeing about
// what `k` means would be worse than either alone, so this is a MIRROR of
// that rule, gated by `scripts/verify_seed_group_parity.py`. The three
// clauses, verbatim from the owner:
//
//   1. Single-model rows only. An ensemble is an evaluation FUNCTION over
//      members, not a training replicate of anything.
//   2. Key = the embedded `zentrain.repro.argv` with the seed flags and the
//      output-path flags (and their values) removed, sha1'd. No argv ⇒
//      UNGROUPABLE.
//   3. Rows inside a key collapse by SEED IDENTITY: two cells with the same
//      recipe AND the same seed are one training run promoted twice
//      (MEASURED: 42 such rows in 33 same-seed groups on the board), so
//      `k` = the number of DISTINCT seeds, never the number of cells.
//
// Clause 2's flag list gained `--init-seed` / `--sample-seed`, and clause 3's
// seed identity became the (init, sample) PAIR, when this same lane split the
// trainer's two RNG streams — a legacy single-`--seed` bake still keys on its
// one seed. Both owners changed together, in this commit.
//
// WHERE THIS DELIBERATELY DIFFERS FROM THE BOARD, and why: `build_seed_groups`
// RETURNS ONLY `k >= 2` groups, because the board renders k=1 rows through a
// different path. `--select` must rank every candidate it was handed, so an
// ungroupable or single-seed cell becomes its OWN group here, flagged
// UNREPLICATED / UNGROUPABLE and never silently dropped. The parity gate
// compares the `k >= 2` partitions, which is the part both owners must agree
// on.
//
// PRIMARY / TIE-BREAK: identical to the per-cell rule (mean floor count, then
// mean `selection_composite`) — just computed over the group's MEAN rather
// than one cell's value, and over one REPRESENTATIVE PER DISTINCT SEED rather
// than every cell (clause 3). Ensembles are excluded by clause 1 and keep
// their existing separate pool, ranked on `balanced_composite` alone.

/// Flags whose presence (and value) must not distinguish two runs of the
/// SAME recipe. Mirrors `gauntlet.SEED_GROUP_DROP_FLAGS` exactly, plus the
/// two seed-split flags this lane introduced.
/// Any flag whose value names a per-run OUTPUT location belongs here, not just the
/// obvious ones: `--dump-checkpoints-dir` was missing, and because its value embeds
/// the seed (`.../LSTAR2_s4031_ckpts` vs `.../LSTAR2_s4033_ckpts`) it split each
/// seed of one recipe into a separate "recipe" — 8 of the 10 top-scoring

// ── REGISTERED AMENDMENT to E.4 — the REPLICATION FLOOR (2026-09-05) ──────
//
// `--seed-group` made `k` VISIBLE. It did not make it BINDING: the rule's
// PRIMARY key is the floor count, so a group with one draw and 8/8 floors
// still outranks a replicated group at 7.22/8. That is exactly what happened
// on the live board — the pick was `62df0d51a60e` = `W10L9_s4003_packed`,
// **k = 1**, 8.00/8 floors, selection_composite 0.9841
// (`benchmarks/replication_wave_2026-09-05.md` §4c.4).
//
// The same wave measured why a single draw must not be selectable:
//
//   * **Replicating the leaders moved them DOWN.** `LSTAR` read composite
//     0.8615 as its best cell and **0.856414** as its k=7 mean; `LSTAR3`
//     0.8608 → 0.856843. Ranks 1 and 2 became 7 and 6 (§4c.1).
//   * **Best-of-k inflation is real and one-sided**: over the 18 combined-fair
//     k≥2 groups, best-of-k minus k-mean has a **+0.0061 median** (§2), which
//     is larger than the 0.0021 span separating the top four groups.
//
// So a k=1 cell's number is a draw from a distribution whose maximum is
// systematically ~0.006 above its mean, competing against groups reported at
// their means. Ranking them together is not a tie-break question, it is a
// units error.
//
// THE AMENDMENT, in two parts:
//
//   A. **REPLICATION FLOOR.** A seed group is SELECTABLE only when
//      `k >= min_k`, default **2** (`--min-k`). Groups below it are LISTED,
//      ranked in their own section, and never selected. `--min-k 1` restores
//      the pre-amendment behavior for reproducing a historical selection.
//
//   B. **FLOOR BASIS = every representative** ([`FloorBasis::AllReps`],
//      default). A group is credited a floor only when EVERY distinct-seed
//      representative passes it. `--floor-basis mean` restores the k-seed
//      mean count.
//
//      Why the stricter reading: a floor is a CERTIFICATION ("this recipe
//      clears CID22"), and a mean is not one. Two members at 8/8 and 6/8
//      average 7.0 whether they fail the same floor twice or two different
//      floors — in the second case the group is credited 7 floors that NO
//      member reliably clears. The intersection cannot do that. It is also
//      the reading consistent with how the balanced profile already treats an
//      ABSENT axis (not-passed, never averaged away), and with part A: both
//      say a number nobody replicated is not a certification. The mean stays
//      REPORTED in its own column, because it is the right estimator for
//      RANKING within a tier — it is just not a floor count.
//
// Neither part relaxes anything: both can only remove a candidate from
// selection, never admit one the pre-amendment rule refused.

/// the PRIMARY key, exactly as the per-cell rule uses `n_pass`.

             Group key = `sha1(zentrain.repro.argv minus the seed and \
             output-path flags)[:12]`, and duplicate promotions of ONE training run collapse by \
             seed identity, so **k = distinct seeds, never cells** — the board's rule \
             (`gauntlet.seed_group_key`, `benchmarks/fair_gauntlet_2026-09-04.md` §1.1), \
             mirrored here so a `--select` group and a board group are the SAME handle. An \
             ensemble or a cell with no embedded argv is UNGROUPABLE — listed, never merged \
             or dropped. Read a group's rank as \"the best RECIPE\"; the per-cell table above \
             answers a different question, \"the best CELL\" (freeze_check §7.7).\n\n\
             **REPLICATION FLOOR (registered amendment, 2026-09-05): `--min-k {}`.** A group \
             with fewer than {} distinct seeds is UNREPLICATED and is NOT selectable — it is \
             listed and ranked in its own section below. Measured reason: replicating the \
             board leaders moved them DOWN (`LSTAR` 0.8615 best cell → 0.856414 at k=7), and \
             best-of-k minus k-mean has a **+0.0061 median** over the 18 combined-fair k≥2 \
             groups — larger than the 0.0021 that separated the top four \
             (`benchmarks/replication_wave_2026-09-05.md` §2, §4c.1). A one-draw number is a \
             sample from a distribution whose maximum sits above its mean; ranking it against \
             means is a units error, not a tie-break. `--min-k 1` restores the pre-amendment \
             behavior.\n\n\
             **FLOOR BASIS: {}.** A group is credited a floor only when EVERY distinct-seed \
             representative passes it (`--floor-basis mean` restores the k-seed mean count). \
             A floor is a certification, and a mean is not one: two members at 8/8 and 6/8 \
             average 7.0 whether they fail the same floor twice or two different floors, and \
             in the second case the group would be credited a floor no member reliably \
             clears. The mean is still reported in its own column.\n\n\
             **The mean is NOT \"the group's true score.\"** Seeds differ in what they SAW, not \
             only in where they landed: the sampler stream is seeded, so two seeds walk the same \
             fixed row population in a different ORDER and a finite-epoch run emphasises a \
             different subset of pairs — objectively different coverage, not noise around one \
             underlying number. The spread column and the per-seed table below are the rest of \
             the answer. Each bake's own `zentrain.sample_coverage` metadata is the per-seed \

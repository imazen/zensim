### [0.2.7] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- `ZensimScratch` reusable scratch buffer and `Zensim::compute_with_ref_into` for zero-allocation encoder loops with a precomputed reference (`71cb95c`).

### Changed
- Color conversion now uses magetypes `cbrt_midp` instead of the scalar-bounce + 2-iteration Halley path; score values shift by at most ~1e-2 absolute / ~2e-4 relative — downstream consumers tracking exact numeric scores should rebase their expectations (`0038bc3`).
- Bump archmage/magetypes minimums to 0.9.23 and switch the blur kernel to the two-block tier-natural-width pattern (`9a9f457`, `b88911d`).
- Bump `zenpixels` and `zenpixels-convert` minimums to 0.2.10 (`6836df6`).

### Fixed
- Cross-platform golden scores rebased to track the `cbrt_midp` swap so ARM, WASM, and AVX-512 tiers stay locked (`b3f7006`).
- `images_byte_identical` short-circuit now also requires matching color primaries, alpha mode, and pixel format before short-circuiting to score=100. Previously two byte-identical buffers labeled with different `ColorPrimaries` (e.g. BT.2020 vs sRGB) were collapsed to "identical" even though their actual displayed colors differ.

### Performance
- Multi-scale diffmap upsample fused into a single power-of-two pass: `diffmap_minimal` ≈ -7.7%, score bit-identical (`c2dd26a`).
- `PrecomputedReference::new` allocates all scales up front and downscales out-of-place: precompute ≈ -65% to -70% at 1080p / 4K (`05146dc`).
- Diffmap masking loop split with hoisted `inv_count` and reciprocal-multiply: `diffmap_full` ≈ -7.5% (`34648b8`).
- Synchronous drop path for small working sets reduces streaming-mode overhead on tiny inputs (`c9cf0ca`).
- Hand-tuned f32x8 v3 path for `downscale_2x_into` (`741bc0e`).

### [0.4.0] - 2026-04-27

Semver-breaking bump because `MontageOptions` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`.
Out-of-crate callers can no longer use struct-literal construction at all
(with or without `..Default::default()` — the Rust language disallows both
on non-exhaustive structs). Migrate to the `Default` + direct-field-assign
pattern; the fields stay public:

```rust
// Before (0.3.x):
let opts = MontageOptions { amplification: 50, ..Default::default() };

// After (0.4.0):
let mut opts = MontageOptions::default();
opts.amplification = 50;
```

This trade lets us add new option fields in subsequent patch releases
without semver breaks.

### Added
- `MontageOptions::expected_label` and `actual_label` allow overriding the
  default `"EXPECTED"` / `"ACTUAL"` panel headers — useful for A/B
  comparisons where that framing doesn't fit (e.g. `"ORIG"` / `"DEFAULT"`)
  (`c1e2c38`).
- `MontageOptions::show_spatial_heatmap` opt-out for A/B comparisons over
  lossy encodings, where every region has full-magnitude differences and
  the 3×3 heatmap strip is uniformly red (`17f55e4`).

### Changed
- `MontageOptions` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`. Subsequent field additions
  will be additive (no further semver breaks). Callers must switch from
  struct-literal construction to `Default::default()` + field assignment.
